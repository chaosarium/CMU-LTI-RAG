For more than 100 years, Spring Carnival has been one of CMU’s most anticipated weekends. Each year, alumni, families and guests join students, faculty and staff on campus to enjoy the student-led traditions of Booth, Buggy, Scotch’n’Soda and Activities Board events, as well as alumni-focused programs, family-friendly activities and much more.

Below are a few Spring Carnival 2024 highlights:
