Spring Carnival 2024 Event CMU Emergency Medical Services Bystander CPR

Title: CMU Emergency Medical Services Bystander CPR
Date: April 13, 2024
Time: 11:30 AM-1:30 PM ET

When someone experiences cardiac arrest, immediate intervention is absolutely necessary. However, most cardiac arrests occur outside of hospitals, limiting the accessibility of professional help. Immediate CPR by a bystander can greatly increase the chance of survival. Hands-only CPR is easy, quick to learn and can empower anyone to become a lifesaver. Stop by this event to learn CPR in twoÂ  easy steps and practice communicating with other bystanders during emergencies. Note: No registration required. No event fee. This event is open to the entire CMU community and their guests.
