Spring Carnival 2024 Faces of Carnival Mosaic

Spring Carnival isn’t the same without you, so make sure you’re included in the Faces of Carnival photo mosaic!

Tartans of all ages from all over the globe can submit a photo to add their faces to this “so CMU” tradition. If you’re attending Spring Carnival, you can stop by the photobooth on Midway throughout the weekend to take a photo!

Don't forget to submit your photo by April 16 to be included in the Faces of Carnival.

Look for your image — along with hundreds of others from throughout the worldwide CMU community — when we share the mosaic on social media and in email after Spring Carnival 2024.
