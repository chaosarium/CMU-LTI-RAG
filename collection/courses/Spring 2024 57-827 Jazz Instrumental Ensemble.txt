Course Description: This ensemble incorporates a comprehensive approach to Big Band performance and study. The music performed is drawn from all eras of big band repertoire with occasional programs of specific composers and genres.  The ensemble is carefully coordinated with the Jazz Vocal Ensemble and major ensembles in order to challenge and prepare students for professional music career opportunities.  The ensemble performs on the regular School of Music concert series (2-3 shows per semester) and for on-campus events.  Admission of undergraduate and graduate students is by competitive audition and placement is by the director.  Grading is based on attendance, preparation, and consistent progress.
