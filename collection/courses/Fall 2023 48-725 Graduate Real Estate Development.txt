Course Description: This course teaches the fundamentals of real estate development in the U.S.  You will learn about the real estate development process and the social, economic and regulatory context in which land use and real estate development take place.    We will learn about project team members and processes; market research; site constraints and zoning; basic project budgeting and types of funding sources.  We will also discuss social equity issues related to land use, including affordable housing, racial segregation and economic inequality.  This course typically includes international students which allows us to learn from each other and compare real estate and land use issues in various countries.  The primary objective of this course is for students to understand how these issues might affect their professional and personal lives, whether they become designers, contractors, engineers, public policy professionals or real estate developers. The course includes learning terminology, reading current news articles, and completing a team project, sometimes with a Pittsburgh-based client.  Students will have the first two weeks of class to select nine or 12 credits; 12 credit students will complete additional work.   Open to graduate students from any school including SoA, Tepper and Heinz Undergraduates with instructor permission only
