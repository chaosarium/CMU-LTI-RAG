Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: This is a one-semester course covering the basics of statistics. We will first provide a quick introduction to probability theory, and then cover fundamental topics in mathematical statistics such as point estimation, hypothesis testing, asymptotic theory, and Bayesian inference. If time permits, we will also cover more advanced and useful topics including nonparametric inference, regression and classification. Prerequisites: one- and two-variable calculus and matrix algebra.  Graduate students in degree-seeking programs are given priority.
