Course Description: This course will be a series of workshops delivered in a hybrid format (partially online, partially in person, some independent work) exploring the topics of race and theatre with a primary focus on the US. Students will cover topics such as race and racism, creating welcoming theatre spaces, scene selections, tropes, and strategies for cultural competency and a survey of artists and theatres who have done culturally competent work. Practical skills around creating mission and values, cultural aesthetics, and advocacy will be covered. Students will practice research and critical analysis of various theatre systems as well as creative problem solving.   Classes will not meet every week but the first day of classes August 30 and 31 will be in person where a schedule and syllabus will outline the semester.
