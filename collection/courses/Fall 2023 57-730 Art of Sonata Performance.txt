Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: Two duos share a one- hour lesson in workshop format. Each pair performs for their colleagues and in turn observes the others' instruction, scores in hand. Intensive study of technical and interpretive aspects as well as stylistic awareness and historical context of each sonata or duo is the focus. Sonatas with several movements will be covered in class in their entirety, but if duos are considerably shorter in length, additional duos may be studied during the semester, time-permitting. Performance presence and refinement of ensemble playing, discussion and hearing concepts are encouraged. There will be a recital at the end of the semester where the students will be evaluated on their performance.
