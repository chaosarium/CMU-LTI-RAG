Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: In this advanced studio course, students will focus on creating experimental works of video art exploring a variety of both historical and contemporary approaches to the field. Building from their prior foundational moving image courses, students will have the opportunity to dive deeply into an array of formal and conceptual approaches to the medium. Throughout the semester, students will produce several major assignments focused on the production of video artworks exploring visual effects and abstraction, documentary forms and video essays, performance-for-video, generative video, and multichannel media installation. Each assignment will be supported through relevant video and audio technical demonstrations. Additionally, all the major assignments will be supported by reading and screening homework, benchmark check-in assignments, workshops, visiting artist lectures, and in-progress meetings & critiques. This class will give students the opportunity to independently explore their evolving material and conceptual interests within the language of video and allow students to develop their own research and fabrication strategies unique to their ideas with a supportive community operating in dialogue throughout the planning, making, and exhibiting process. The class will culminate in a public screening event at the end of the semester.
