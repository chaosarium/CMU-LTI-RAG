Course Description: "The Slave Passage" begins among flourishing, technologically advanced, and globally connected regions of Western Africa before the advent of the trans-Atlantic slave trade. It tells the painful story of African captives during the Middle Passage, piecing together the historical record to recognize their suffering aboard the slaving vessels and their multiple strategies of resistance. Students will study slave narratives,  slave ship logs, and autobiographies of former enslaved people, as well as analyze films depicting the Middle Passage and New World enslavement.
