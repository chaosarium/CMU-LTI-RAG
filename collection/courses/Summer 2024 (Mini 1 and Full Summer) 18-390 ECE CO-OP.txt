Course Description: The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon   considers experiential learning opportunities important educational   options for its undergraduate students. One such option is cooperative   education, which provides a student with an extended period of exposure   with a company.  To participate, students must complete an ECE Co-op   Approval form (located in HH 1115) and submit for approval. Students   must possess at least junior status and have an overall grade point   average of 3.0 or above. All co-ops must be approximately 8 months in   uninterrupted length. If the co-op is approved, the ECE Undergraduate   Studies Office will add the course to the student's schedule. Upon   completion of the co-op experience, students must submit a 1-2 page   report of their work experience, and a 1-2 page evaluation from the   company supervisor to the ECE Undergraduate Office. International   students should also be authorized by the Office of International   Education (OIE). More information regarding CPT is available on OIE's   website.
