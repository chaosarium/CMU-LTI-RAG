Course Description: In this course, we will take computational approaches to explore information design in space. Students will consider the interactivity and readability of information when creating data-driven systems. They will learn Javascript programming and use P5.js for their interactive systems. There will be three projects: 1) Speech-responsive Kiosk;  2) Immersive Space using Projection; and 3) Data Visualization using Holo Lens. There is no prerequisite for this course, but basic understanding of typography and information design is expected.
