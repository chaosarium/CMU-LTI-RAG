Course Description: Theatre is a global art form, and the average student's knowledge of world drama is made possible by the practice of translating seminal works into the English language. But what if a play has more than one translation? How does a theatre artist/scholar choose which text is right for their project? And what do you do when you don't speak the other language in question? Dramaturgy 5: Dramaturgy in Translation will introduce students to contemporary theories and questions of translation studies and equip them with a set of best practices for selecting the most appropriate text for their needs. Speaking a language in addition to English is not required for this course.
