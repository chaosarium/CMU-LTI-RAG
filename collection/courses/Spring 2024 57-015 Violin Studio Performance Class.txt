Course Description: Once a week throughout the semester a "violin studio performance class" takes place. A studio class is a most important performance opportunity as it is a step between the studio lessons and the concert stage. Students perform the repertoire they are working on in front of the class and Prof. Forough. Along with comments from the class, Prof. Forough works one on one with each student.  The repertoire performed can be solo pieces or accompanied pieces.  This class is for violin majors who are studying with Prof. Forough.  Other students may audit the class.
