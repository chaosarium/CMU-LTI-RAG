Course Description: If you're interested in community and infrastructure design, have you considered how "green" strategies may vary around the world?  Are there universal goals for the design of sustainable transportation, water systems or energy infrastructure, or is there a national or local context?  48795 A4 is a graduate level mini-course that compares global community and infrastructure rating systems to gain perspective about these topics.  The course uses two rating systems--the LEED Cities & Communities Rating System and Envision, from the Institute for Sustainable InfrastructureÂ¿as springboards for exploration and discussion of world rating systems that address these topics.  The course provides a foundation for taking USGBC's LEED Green Associate and/or LEED Accredited Professional exams, or the ISI Envision Sustainability Professional exam and is designed to hone your critical thinking about sustainable urban design and infrastructure development in a global context.
