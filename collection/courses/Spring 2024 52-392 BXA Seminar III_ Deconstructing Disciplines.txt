Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: BXA Seminar III is in preparation for the BXA Capstone Project and/or other senior research projects (Dietrich/MCS/SCS thesis, or CFA senior studio work). The seminar will engage BXA juniors in a brief examination of the structures of disciplinary knowledge, interdisciplinary approaches, and the components of research, with production of original work as the primary class requirement. The course is designed with maximum flexibility for various schedule conflicts and attendance; check course syllabus for meeting times and options. Coursework includes short readings and self-assessment exercises, participation in seminar discussions, preparation of the Junior Portfolio and professional documents (CV), and the production of new research or creative works. These can take one of three forms: 1) a small proof of concept object 2) the initiation of one stage of larger research plans or 3) a complete Capstone proposal. Any of these may be the basis of the student's eventual Capstone or other senior work. The requirements for this semester also include a short 5 page literature review about the student's topic, inclusion of work during the BXA Kaleidoscope show (last week of April), and a class research presentation showcase held during the final exam period.
