Course Description: How do you fix the following compilation error: "PROGRAMMER IS INSUFFICIENTLY POLITE"? How do you bake a cake while printing "Hello world!" Welcome to the wonderful world of esoteric programming languages, where everything is possible but nothing of interest is easy. Learn how to write a program that you can't see, compute factorials using Microsoft PowerPoint, and compile a painting. Along the way, we'll answer questions like "What is a programming language?" and "Why does my compiler have indigestion?" Step into the realm of ">>[-]<<[->>+<<]" and come explore the outer boundaries of relatively sane computation. Some knowledge of computer science is helpful, though not required, to take this course.
