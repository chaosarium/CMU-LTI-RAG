Course Description: (Session 2) - The first year or two of a tech start-up set the trajectory and character of that company for years to come. Too few entrepreneurs appreciate this reality and, as a result, many carry forward misperceptions and misconceptions about creating and building a successful tech company that set it on the path for failure.   This class attempts to remedy that challenge by exposing the student the practical reality of  building a team and funding a start-up team. This class should help the student answer (or know how to find the answer) to the following questions:   How do I find manage and evaluate a start-up team Do I have the skill motivation and ability to be a tech entrepreneur? Can I build a company from scratch (really?)? Should I be the CEO Sales Account Manager VP of Engineering or something else altogether?  How much money do I raise and where and when do I raise it?   Students will have the opportunity to apply their newfound practical skills gathered in part from lectures from experienced entrepreneurs and investors to case studies.
