<start course description for 60-360 Critical Studies: Painting in the Expanded Field: Theory and History>
Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: Painting has always been secretly (and not so secretly) unruly¿sometimes unable to fit¿morally, scale-wise, discipline-specific¿into conventional salons, galleries, or museums. This seminar will follow the vast, stormy line from Courbet's 22 ft. long, audacious, Burial at Ornans (1849-50) to Torkwase Dyson's Indeterminacy #1 (Black Compositional Thought) (2022) which looms at architectural scale (crossing the divides between architecture, sculpture, painting) to the abject painting treatments (2010-present) of Leidy Churchman in which live human bodies lie under unhinged canvases upon which paint, syrup, powder, potato chips, and a whip (and other substitutes for paint/brushes) are wielded with equal force. We will excavate history, theory, and practice equally, but our focus will mainly be on artists working today. Other expanded painters (& possible guest speakers), just to name a few, include: Suki Seokyeong Kang, Wangechi Mutu, Tschabalala Self, Carrie Yamaoka, Genesis Tramaine, Kehinde Wiley, Maxwell Alexandre, Cy Gavin, Jennifer Packer, Kerry James Marshall, Faith Ringgold, Glenn Lignon, Gelitin, Laura Owens, Kai Althoff, Rachel Rossin and Mickalene Thomas.
