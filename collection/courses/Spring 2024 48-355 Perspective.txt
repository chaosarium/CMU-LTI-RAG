Course Description: This freehand drawing course considers perspective from three understandings of perceptual psychology. Part 1, built on the pedagogy of Kimon Nicolaides, aligns with the Transactionalist understanding of perception. It considers perspective as discovered truth. Part 2 builds on the early work of perceptual psychologist, J.J. Gibson, and aligns with the Ecological position of Gibson and his followers. It considers perspective as an absolute truth of the visual field. Part 3, aligning implicitly with Gestalt psychology, treats perspective as an imposed schema. The course concludes with a final project built around the student's interest.
