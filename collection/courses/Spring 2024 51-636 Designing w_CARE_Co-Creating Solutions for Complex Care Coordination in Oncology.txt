Course Description: What does providing healthcare to patients with complex care coordination needs mean? How do we build processes and systems to ensure patients and family members receive the care they need and want? How can design thinking help healthcare institutions improve population health, reduce costs, enhance the care experience, including the care team's well-being, and advance health equity? How can we design effective communication systems to foster patient-centered care throughout the continuum of care for all patients?   It is a tremendous opportunity to gain first-hand experience through interactions with healthcare providers, patients, and their caregivers. Students from various disciplines can apply their knowledge and perspective to propose a solution for a real-world healthcare problem.
