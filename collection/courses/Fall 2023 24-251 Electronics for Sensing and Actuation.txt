Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: Mechanical engineers design, build, and troubleshoot basic circuits that perform signal conditioning on sensor measurements and provide power amplification for actuation.  This course covers the basics of passive circuit design, applications of operational amplifiers, and the use of transistors to amplify low power signals coming from microcontrollers.  Lecture materials are coupled with hands-on in-class exercises and homework assignments using the Arduino to interface with sensors and actuators.
