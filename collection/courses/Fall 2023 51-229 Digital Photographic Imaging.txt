Course Description: The objective of this course is to provide students with a practical, technical and theoretical foundation in digital imaging. The primary software for this course is Adobe Photoshop, with which students will explore construction, combination, manipulation, input, and output of image as a means of narrative creation. Through project critique and other discussion, we will also consider the aesthetic and political implications of the emergence of this and other new electronic imaging technologies.
