Course Description: During the semester students who are Graduate Assistants for an ETC Course can earn academic credit (12 units) or opt for compensation. The goal of this course is to provide supporting information to help Course GAs succeed in this role while also reflecting on their responsibilities and ways to improve. Students will be evaluated by the instructor(s) of record for the course in which they are a GA. The expectations and responsibilities will be clearly presented to the GA(s) throughout the semester. These can include, but are not limited to, the following:Holding office hours each week,Coordinating with other GAs on attendance and other classroom management activities, Answering emails and questions submitted to the course dlists (or other communication systems) from students taking the course,Setting up additional related workshops as needed and coordinating with guest speakers, Returning graded assignments, Keeping course calendars, websites, and other course materials up-to-date Note: Course GAs need to balance their time. Fulfilling your responsibilities as a Course GA should not interfere with on your own studies, particularly with the ETC Project Course, and is not a legitimate excuse in this regard.
