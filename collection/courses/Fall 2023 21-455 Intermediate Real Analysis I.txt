Course Description: This course provides a rigorous and proof-based treatment of the general theory of functions on metric spaces.  The course serves as a more advanced version of 21-355 Principles of Real Analysis and is primarily intended for students who have taken 21-269.  Topics include: Metric spaces: Completeness, density, separability, compactness, connectedness.  Baire theorem and applications. Contraction maps: fixed points, applications, inverse, and implicit  function theorems.  Spaces of functions: uniform and pointwise convergence, Stone-Weierstrass theorem, Arzela-Ascoli theorem.  (Three 50 minute lectures, one 50 minute recitation)
