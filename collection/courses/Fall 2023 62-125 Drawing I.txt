Course Description: 62-125 is an introductory course in free-hand architectural drawing.  Its central learning objective is building a capacity for visualizing three-dimensional space through freehand drawing.  A parallel objective is fostering visual literacy: the ability to use line and tonal values to represent architectural space.  Topics covered are contour drawing, freehand perspective, axonometric projection, and tonal drawing in charcoal.  The course concludes with a final project conducted jointly with 48-100, first-year architectural design.
