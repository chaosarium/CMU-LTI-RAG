Course Description: The capstone project course is a group-oriented demonstration of student skill in one or more areas covered by the degree. Typically the result of the capstone project is a major software application. The capstone project course consists of two components.  The classroom component guides students in project planning, team management, development of requirements and design specifications, and software tools for managing group-oriented projects.  The lab component provides project-specific technical guidance and expertise, for example in the development of a question answering system, dialog, or sentiment analysis application.  Thus, each project receives two types of supervision, often from two separate members of the faculty.
