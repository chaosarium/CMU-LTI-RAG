Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: This course investigates the cultural history of the post-Revolutionary Russian emigration to capitals of Europe, North America, and Asia. We will examine the life of Russian émigré communities in each of these cities, through poetry, literary fiction, memoirs, and diaries. In addition to developing students' cultural awareness, this course aims to advance Russian language learning by expanding students' vocabulary, reinforcing grammatical knowledge, and developing their capacity to speak and write on abstract topics. The readings will be available in English, though students will be encouraged to read the works in Russian. In addition to discussing the texts in Russian, students will complete short weekly homework assignments. **If you would like to take this course, but the current time slot does not work with your schedule please contact the instructor as soon as possible and we may be able to accommodate you**
