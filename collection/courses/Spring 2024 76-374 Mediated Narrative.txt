Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: We are offering the opportunity to travel into the future, build it, and represent it in  creative and critical ways. The Mediated Narrative: Futuristic Explorations course  aims to explore the concept of the future, analyze its representations, and create  a media project based on potential utopian/dystopian areas of human progress  and evolution. Students will have to recreate and represent their own visions of  the future through a media project. Essential to the research and development of  the class is the concept of humanity and empathy within a technological social  world. Ideas such as: "reality ahead of schedule"; "high tech, low life"; "neon and  corporate dystopias"; "cyberpunk"; "post-human"; "sustainability"; etc, will be  analyzed and discussed in class. Concepts of civilization, the cityscape, the  individual, the body and the mind will be examined as we have seen technology  and society evolve. During the 2024 spring semester there will be two onsite  visits to historical places that under similar idealist social premises of the future  have embodied diverse existential outcomes: a) The city of Arcosanti in the  Arizona dessert b) The Old Economy Village in Pennsylvania. Both places  represent a utopian philosophy of life which attempted to be in synchronicity with  everyday life. The idea is to map traditional futuristic themes and styles and find  new ways to represent them based on the needs and contradictions in our  present world.
