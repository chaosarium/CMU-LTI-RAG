Students will evaluate various models for community engagement and community-based leadership and examine ethical and social justice issues related to college and university involvement in the community. Through course discussions and direct engagement with community leaders, students will develop the ability to consider multiple perspectives, demonstrate cultural humility and critically reflect to make meaning from experiences.
