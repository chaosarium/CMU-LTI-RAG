Portfolio's capacity to represent a body of work and as a storytelling tool is emphasized in this course. The course proposes a fresh way of thinking about portfolio types and their content. Portfolio is a document through which you invite an audience to explore mediums of your creative thinking, forms of imagination, sense of materiality and possibilities of shaping the real conditions. The course deals with curating the content, editing your portfolio, resume, cover letters and work sample design. We shall look at myriad drawing types, layouts, typefaces and get into technicality of workflow, project sequence and details of the portfolio. In each session we shall select a particular content of the portfolio and discuss through presentations, diagrams, key references and students' work. Each project has its prompt, is unique in terms of its scale, modes of investigation and tools of representation. A successful portfolio shows diverse tools of thinking and communication.
