Course Description: PLEASE NOTE: The specific meeting dates for the A1 section of this micro course are Sep 24, Oct 1, Oct 8. The specific meeting dates for the A2 section of this micro course are Oct 28, Nov 4, Nov 11. This workshop is a hands-on introduction to the expansive world of 3D printing. 3D printing is a popular and versatile technology for quickly prototyping ideas. Students learn prototyping basics and the Fusion360 CAD software to create their own unique projects.  Computer-controlled manufacturing process is driven by CAD design. The class time will explore the capabilities of 3D modeling and their transformation into a printable format. No technical experience is required, although basic knowledge of digital media creation, such as vector drawings, is helpful.
