Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: This course explores the changing role and powers of the American Presidency under the Constitution, from the founding era through the twentieth century. After absorbing drafting and ratification debates, we will focus on how particular presidents (Washington, Lincoln, FDR, Nixon) established or expanded the executive power and how particular conflicts (the Civil War, the "Court Packing" plan, Watergate) restructured or restricted the presidency. Readings will include the U.S. Constitution (of course), selections from The Federalist Papers, and short books including Daniel Farber's "Lincoln's Constitution" and Cass Sunstein's "Impeachment: A Citizen's Guide." Grades will be based on three short papers, a final paper, and daily preparedness and participation in group discussion.
