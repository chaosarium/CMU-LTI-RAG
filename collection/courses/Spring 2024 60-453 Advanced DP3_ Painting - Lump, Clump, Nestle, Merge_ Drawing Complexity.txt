Course Description: Forming groups and creating relationships is core to composition (and to society). Compositional considerations in painting and drawing are crucial in visualizing narratives. How settings are established, elements arranged, characters depicted and actions delineated within a static frame remains vital.   We will examine modes of framing, methods of identification and categorization, and characteristics of group formation and dynamics. Discussion topics include diverse active depictions of, and tactics for, promoting common cause: pillow talk, gossip, back room deals, house parties, clubs, and political rallies.   Our own work will emphasize portrayals of complicated real or imagined events, whether detailed or generalized for emotional affect. Open themes of the grand, intimate, desperate, and celebratory will be plastic and permeable to facilitate experimentation and inspire individually directed and ambitious projects.   Formal presentations, technical demonstrations, visiting lectures, museum trips, and film screenings complement studio time devoted toward independent and class projects.
