Course Description: The capstone builds on the concepts and skills taught in the five-course data science curriculum during the first year of the program. As a second-year MSCF student, you will work with fellow students on data mining, modeling and visualization techniques along with statistical and machine learning methods to address a real-world challenge at a financial firm. Throughout the 14-week initiative, you will be supported by an MSCF faculty member and guided by company mentors to help achieve the project goals. The capstone concludes in December with a final report and presentation to faculty and client representatives.  Non-MSCF students may not take this course without written permission from the instructor. To be eligible, you must be a BSCF student or a graduate student enrolled in an MSCF participating college (Dietrich, Heinz, Tepper or Mellon). PhD students with relevant research may be eligible with permission from the instructor.
