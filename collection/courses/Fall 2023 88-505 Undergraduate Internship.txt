Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: An internship is an approved and monitored work experience than can be related to an academic field of study through active reflection and specific learning goals.  Students must work at least 10 hours per week for the semester at the internship.  Additionally, students will also keep in regular contact with a faculty member in Social and Decision Sciences, who will assign and evaluate academic work.  Internships are available for 1-9 units, depending on the type and amount of academic work produced. Students are responsible for finding their own internships and faculty sponsors, although assistance is available in the department.  Students must also complete an "Internship Learning Agreement" form, available from the SDS Advisors in Porter 208H and 208G.
