Course Description: This course will deepen your understanding of the possibilities for writers engaged with the genre of Creative Non-Fiction. We'll be reading books and essays from a variety of writers, including CMU graduate Neema Avashia, whose collected book of essays has been recently published. We'll read essays and memoir that illumine the formation of identity, that question the status quo, that celebrate human connection, and that often shine a light on injustices shaping our world. Students will write their own essays and memoir, and class will be conducted as a discussion where all will be expected to show up regularly, and remain engaged so as to create a place where students get to know one another and support each other as writers.
