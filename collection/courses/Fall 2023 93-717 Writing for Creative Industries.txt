Course Description: Communication in written form is an essential element of being a professional in the creative industries. Writing for museums, galleries, performing arts organizations, production companies, distribution enterprises, talent agencies, and other contexts in arts and entertainment management challenges students to convey critical thinking by anticipating readers' needs and the perspectives of stakeholders. The writing skills integral to this process include: targeting diverse audiences with varying levels of expertise and roles, developing essential and persuasive content, communicating complex ideas coherently, organizing information, ensuring clarity, moderating tone, designing a document for readability, and maintaining format norms. Students will analyze real-world documents relevant to careers in arts and entertainment management, revise online content, craft strategic quotes for press releases, and write industry-specific reports or proposals. Writing resources and specialized sample documents (e.g. development letters, grant proposals, strategic plans, media research reports, script coverage, media alerts, etc.) will be provided. Note: This course assumes proficiency in English grammar. Numerous resources for improving written English skills are provided via Canvas.
