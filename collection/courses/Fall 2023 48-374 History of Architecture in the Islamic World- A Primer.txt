Course Description: An introduction to the architecture of the lands where Islam spread over the centuries, this course aims to provide a basic understanding of major epochs and regional variations. We will learn the function and meaning of the most important building types, examine how these types changed over time to adapt to the needs of changing societies and consider influences and exchanges with other traditions. We will examine the historical context within which art and architecture developed and explore critically the lingering signs of those traditions in contemporary society.
