Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: A general background on problems, methods, and tools for solving analysis and synthesis problems in process engineering. Formulation and numerical solutions of steady-state and dynamic simulation and optimization problems will be discussed. Insights and solution methods are also covered, based on both heuristics and mixed-integer programming techniques for the synthesis of heat exchanger networks, separation processes, and total process systems.
