Course Description: The Barbie animated movie franchise has shaped a generation who grew up with retellings of classic fairytales and inspirations of female empowerment. Dubbed by fans as the "Barbie Cinematic Universe" (BCU), the animated movie franchise began in 2001 and now has over 40 films and various web series. The BCU has recently resurfaced in popularity with the resurgence of early 2000s nostalgia and Greta Gerwig's 2023-billion-dollar box office hit, Barbie. Throughout this course, we will dive into the history of Barbie, dissect the evolution of BCU films, and shed light on problematic themes and elements throughout the franchise. Specific topics to discuss include, but are not limited to queer allegories, antisemitism, and the Barbie Cinematic Universe theory. This course will be highly discussion based, so it is important that all students are engaged and actively participating in classroom conversations. No prerequisite knowledge is required, only enthusiasm and excitement for Barbie!
