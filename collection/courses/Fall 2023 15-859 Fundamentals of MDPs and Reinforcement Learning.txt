Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: This advanced graduate-level course provides a deep dive into the mathematical foundations and algorithms of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Students will explore key topics such as stochastic approximation, TD-learning, Q-learning, policy gradient methods, actor-critic methods, multi-armed bandits, and online RL. The course emphasizes rigorous mathematical proofs and derivations. It is ideal for students with strong mathematical maturity and interested in developing a deep understanding of the mathematical foundation underpinning RL algorithms.
