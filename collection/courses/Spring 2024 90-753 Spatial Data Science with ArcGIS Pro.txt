Course Description: Advanced Geographic Information Systems will explore timely and relevant topics affecting our world today and build on skills learned in the first GIS course.  The structure of the course will be a mix of individual and project-based group work.   Topics covered include Web-based GIS (Google Maps, Github / ArcGIS / Mapbox integrations for web-based output), Production GIS (project management, customization, project scoping and delivery), and Spatial Data Science.   Additional, timely topics may be introduced as the course progresses.   A solid foundation in Geographic Information Systems in general and significant experience with ArcGIS Pro is required.  Students should feel comfortable investigating and working with applications and methods unfamiliar to them without always having the benefit of a step-by-step guide, and demonstrate a willingness to learn, experiment and take initiative when working on individual and group-based project work.
