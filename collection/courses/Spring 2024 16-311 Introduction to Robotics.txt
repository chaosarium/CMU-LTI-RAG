Course Description: This course presents an overview of robotics in practice and research with topics including vision, machine learning, motion planning, mobile mechanisms, kinematics, inverse kinematics, and sensors. In course projects, students construct LEGO robots which are driven by a microcontroller, with each project reinforcing the basic principles developed in lectures. Students usually work in teams of three: an electrical engineer, a mechanical engineer, and a computer scientist. Groups are typically self-formed except for the first lab.  This course will also expose students to some of the contemporary happenings in robotics, including current robotics research, applications, robot contests and robots in the news.  Students registering for this course must register for both Mon/Wed mornings and Tuesday afternoon sections.
