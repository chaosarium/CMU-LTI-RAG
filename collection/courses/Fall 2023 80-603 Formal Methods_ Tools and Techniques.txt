Course Description: The formal methods seminar series introduces a variety of formal structures that have broad applicability to issues of philosophical interest. This mini covers some of the foundational concepts, methods, and examples of math and logic, such as: basic set theory, functions and relations, number systems, common proof techniques (e.g., mathematical induction), introductory propositional logic, and probabilistic reasoning. It can serve as preparation for 80-610 but should not be taken after this course.
