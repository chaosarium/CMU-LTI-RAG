Course Description: This repeatable course explores target cultures through a thematic or conceptual focus. Students critically analyze authentic documents through, for example, cultural, social, historical, biographical, filmic, artistic, literary, musical, linguistic, and theoretical perspectives, while improving and expanding their language skills.    F23: This course analyzes postwar Japan's subculture as a creative force that is vital to its counter-discourses against the dominant ones in the mainstream. Ubiquitous and often volatile, various forms of the subculture have emerged in critical junctures of postwar Japanese society and culture, from the Occupation (1945-1952), to the Americanization in the 1950s, to the Japanese version of the student movement in the 1960s, to numerous trends out of the economic euphoria in the 1970s-1980s. Collectively those various forms of Japan's subculture foreshadow the essential components of contemporary Japan's popular culture and changing social norms. Taught in Japanese.
