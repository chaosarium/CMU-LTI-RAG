Course Description: FALL 2023: Mapping Dreams and Nightmares: Seeing and Writing the US-Mexico Border  This course will focus on the US-Mexico border, with particular emphasis on visual representations of the border from both the US and Mexico, and on the unique, vibrant fronteriza cultures that result in the space betwixt and between.  The course will emphasize key moments and events in the history of the border, including for example the Mexican Revolution, the creation of the border patrol in the 1920s, the Bracero program, Operation Wetback, the Chicano movement, Operation Gatekeeper, and will consider how visual and textual representations have responded to and been conditioned by the political and economic relationship between the US and Mexico, particularly in the wake of neoliberal policies. We will draw on a wide variety of materials, including film, video, visual arts, performance, border theory, and literary and journalistic texts.  (This sections is taught in English)
