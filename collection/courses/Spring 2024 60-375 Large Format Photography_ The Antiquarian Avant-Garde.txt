Course Description: This course will explore alternative photographic techniques and concepts in an effort to extend the boundaries of the photographic image. Through the course we will explore contemporary digital imaging techniques and apply them to turn-of-the-last-century hand applied emulsions and use large format film cameras to create contemporary tintypes. Subjects covered are digital imaging, digital negative printing and workflow, Platinum, Van Dyke, Cyanotype, and Pigment over Platinum printing, while exploring alternative uses of polaroid photography, and concepts and theory of the still image. As we move through the course, we will also study the history of photography and many ways to create an image that are not standard in today's imaging practices. A diverse range of contemporary photographic work will be presented to increase students' visual awareness and understanding of the possibilities inherent in the medium. Through work/review sessions, students will be encouraged to evaluate their own ideas and judgments in pursuit of a well-communicated image.
