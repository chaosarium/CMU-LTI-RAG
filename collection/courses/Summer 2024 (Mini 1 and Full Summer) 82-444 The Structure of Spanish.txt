Course Description: This course will provide students with a theoretical framework and analytic tools to investigate how Spanish speakers represent, construct, and transform their social worlds. In particular, the focus is on language as a social practice through which power relations are maintained or challenged. Using a variety of spoken and written texts, the course seeks to analyze to explore the discourse-semantic and lexico-grammatical features that Spanish users deploy to make meanings and negotiate understandings. This analysis will later be interpreted from an interdisciplinary perspective drawing on social theory and history.  FALL 2017: This course is an advanced introduction-in Spanish-to contemporary "print," digital and visual media from North, Central & South America, and the Caribbean, and how "information" and "opinion" produce, disseminate, and communicate specific messages. We will review and analyze the rhetorical and visual toolse.g., style, tone, perspective, purpose, exaggeration, distortion, symbolism, labels, irony, and allusionsthese texts deploy to determine their role in meaning making for readers and viewers. A primary goal for this course is for students to develop and sharpen the skills necessary to determine reliability in information sources, and hone their ability to write and talk about this.
