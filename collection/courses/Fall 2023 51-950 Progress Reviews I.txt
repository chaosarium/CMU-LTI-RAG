Course Description: Design proceeds by way of critique. Being a recent discipline, design research is especially in need of frequent in-progress exposure. This is even more the case for emergent epistemologies of practice-based design research. Consequently, all candidates in all doctoral programs are required to give progress review presentations before their peers and a panel of experts that demonstrate significant progress on methodologically valid forms of design research in response to clearly articulated research questions.
