Course Description: Arabic for Global Exchange Online focuses primarily on learning about Arab culture with a minor focus on learning functional Arabic language.  The course introduces learners to basic concepts and information to facilitate entry and engagement in an Arabic-speaking environment, and utilizes instructional materials to introduce basic cultural knowledge and survival language.  This is a mini-course for individuals with no proficiency or extremely limited knowledge of Arabic language and Arab culture. Each of the six lessons in the course includes texts and activities to promote acquisition of cultural content in English as well as basic introductory exposure to the Arabic language.  Synchronous individual or small group online meetings to discuss course content will be arranged during the first week of the course. All course materials are hosted by the Online Learning Initiative, with guidance provided by the instructor via Canvas. Class evaluation is based on contributions to online discussion forums, synchronous online meetings in English with the instructor, synchronous online meetings in Arabic with a speaking assistant, and a final project.
