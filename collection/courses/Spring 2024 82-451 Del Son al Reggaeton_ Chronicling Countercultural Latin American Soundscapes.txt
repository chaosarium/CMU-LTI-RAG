Course Description: This repeatable course explores cultures of Latin America through thematic or conceptual focus. Students analyze authentic documents through, for example, historical, biographical, filmic, artistic, literary, musical, and theoretical perspectives, while improving and expanding their language skills.  SPRING 2024:In this course we explore Latin American popular music, from traditional son and bomba to salsa, contemporary rock en español, bachata, cumbia, and reggaetón. With an emphasis on how these rhythms are represented across Latin American cultural production, we examine a variety of literary and non-literary cultural texts (e.g. readings by authors like Julio Cortázar, Rosario Ferré, Ana Lydia Vega, Rita Indiana, and others, alongside films like Ya no estoy aquí and Talento de barrio, and documentaries like Ritmo Salvaje, plus ads, songs, music videos, etc.). Our main objective is to understand how engaging with these rhythms shapes local and global counter/cultural identities and groups. We adopt an interactive and multi-modal approach to learning in which students document their observations through blogging, vlogging, podcasting, and optional dancing experiences for those eager to experiment the influence of popular music firsthand. The course encourages active participation in classroom discussions to foster critical thinking and analytical skills.
