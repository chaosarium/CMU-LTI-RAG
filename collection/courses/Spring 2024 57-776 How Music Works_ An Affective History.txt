Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: This is an historical survey of (a) aesthetic theories about music and human agency--music's affects and effects, thus its significance and even its very existence--and of (b) actual utilizations of music.  Theories range from Aristotle's catharsis to trauma theory and neuromusicology in our time.  The applications range from the biblical David's therapeutic harp playing in the court of King Saul (11th C. BCE) to U.S. interrogators in Iraq (21st C. CE); from Vodun and exorcisms in other cultures to MUZAK in our own.    In short, it's a chronological survey of what peoples have believed about music's powers and, consequently, how music has been used and abused.   The dialectic between theory and applications is reflected in the assignments.  This seminar is heavily focused on reading, as well as written and verbal discussion.  There is also a long-term field project.
