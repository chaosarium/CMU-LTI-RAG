Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: In Medieval Spain and Portugal, Islam, Judaism and Christianity coexisted in a situation distinguished by cooperation and exchange, as well as by friction, rivalry and violence. In this course, we shall explore the complexity of this unique historical encounter, as well as its role in shaping debates over modern Iberian and global identities, and historical memory. We shall discuss topics such as: Inter-ethnic collaboration and violence; Jewish-Christian disputations; the exclusion and expulsion of religious and ethnic minorities; as well as Muslim and Jewish presence in present day Spain and Portugal. Historical documents, literary texts, film, musical traditions, as well as contemporary political and cultural debates will be discussed to enhance familiarity with the topic.
