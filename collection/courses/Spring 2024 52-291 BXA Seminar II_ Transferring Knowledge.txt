Course Description: BXA Seminar II considers how interdisciplinary work can be produced, analyzed, justified andmost importantlycontextualized. By taking a deep dive into a single object or text, we'll explore how context situates the creator, the audience, and their relationship. At the end of the course, students will have a better understanding of how disciplinary methods establish context, and they'll be able to use this understanding to help guide their academic choices.
