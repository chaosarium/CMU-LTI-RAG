Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: This course is part of the post-intermediate, 300-level program that forms the introduction to the major or minor in Hispanic Studies. Students may begin with any one of the three courses at this level or they may be taken concurrently.  This course provides an introduction to and analysis of the cultures and histories of U.S. Latinos.  The course will trace the historical trajectories of these groups, both those dating back centuries, such as Mexican-Americans and certain Caribbean populations, and those with more recent, quickly growing populations, such as Salvadoran and Honduran immigrants, in an effort to understand how their identities are forged and transformed over time, considering both internal and external perspectives.  Our exploration of U.S. Latino history and cultures will compare and contrast the experiences of people from the above-described categories and analyze the dynamic tension amongst them, with other minority groups, and with the mainstream US society. We will examine a wide variety of materials, including texts, film, art, music etc. in order to gain a better understanding of Latino populations in the United States. Ultimately, we seek to question and to understand the complexities of Latinidad in the 21st century U.S. The course will be taught in Spanish.
