Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: In this course, students will work on an interdisciplinary, design-build project to improve the quality of life through design interventions on campus. The semester will begin with a review of design proposals developed during the Fall semester, and through a collaborative process the class will determine what can be built given budgetary and workforce constraints. Students will complete construction documents, deÂ­velop project management plans, build full scale prototypes, procure materials, and construct the designs.
