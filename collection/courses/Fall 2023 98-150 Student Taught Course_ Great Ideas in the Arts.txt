Course Description: "Course objective will focus on tackling different topics in the Arts. Every week, there will be a different topic covered along with a different fun assignment. This will be a workshop style course that will hopefully open up eyes to creativity and shift perspectives in how one sees the world and observes it. Some key topics include: - analysis of media and attention to detail in comics, games, movies etc - tackling feeling uninspired - What makes everyday objects so great for art, turning the ordinary into the extraordinary - creating your own fantasy world - face composition - human body form & flow - expressing emotions visually through a piece of art  As Bob Ross once said, ""We don't make mistakes, just happy little accidents."""
