<start course description for 66-504 Senior Capstone I>
Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: Dietrich College student-defined majors (primary or additional) must complete a senior capstone project for at least 9 units (in one semester), or 18 units across both semesters of the senior year.  The capstone project culminates in an original independent research or creative project that draws on all of the strands of the student's particular student-defined program. This course (66-504) is the first in a two-course capstone sequence open only to seniors who have been admitted to the Dietrich College Student-Defined Program as a primary or additional major, and who choose the two-semester capstone sequence option. The second course in the sequence is 66-505, Senior Capstone II.  Projects are proposed by eligible students, and must be approved by a member of the faculty who agrees to be the project's primary advisor, as well as by the Dietrich College Student-Defined Program Director.  These approvals must be secured no later than registration week of the semester prior to the start of the student's senior year.  NOTE: For Dietrich College student-defined majors (primary or additional) who are accepted into the Dietrich College Senior Honors Program and who successfully complete a senior honors thesis based primarily on their student-defined major, the senior honors thesis fulfills the student-defined major capstone requirement.
