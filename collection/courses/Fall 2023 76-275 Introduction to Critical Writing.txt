Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: (This course was formerly titled Critical Writing Workshop.) The goal of this course is to sharpen your ability to read and write about literary and other imaginative works. Critical reading and writing mean gathering and evaluating language and images to form an interpretation of a print, visual, or other media text. To that end, you will learn analytical keywords and terms from literary and cultural theory and how to apply them to texts and other objects. The focus will be on theories of race and gender and how they inform literary texts and our reading of them. Our course's method for critical writing instruction will be to workshop drafts of your essays. To that end, you will write four short interpretive papers in the course. You will also gain practice at oral presentation, peer-review and critique. To help us fine tune and integrate our critical skills we will spend the semester writing and thinking though genre, the categories by which we name and understand literature, and other media. Since this is a writing workshop and our time for reading will be somewhat limited, we are focusing on "the gothic" and its literary legacies from the 18th into the 20th century. The communication and analytic skills you acquire in this class will transfer to your work in a wide range of academic disciplines and professional contexts.
