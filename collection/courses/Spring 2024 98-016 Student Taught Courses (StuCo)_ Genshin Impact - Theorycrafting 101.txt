Course Description: The purpose of this class is to deepen student's understanding of Genshin Impact's game mechanics with emphasis on numbers-based theorycrafting, the "Iceberg" of game mechanics, and some lore. Students will develop the skills necessary to construct optimized teams, create their own rotations, and clear spiral abyss with ease. We emphasize ease of access, so this class will mostly discuss optimal "Free-To-Play" team options. However, instructors will briefly go over constellation mechanics.
