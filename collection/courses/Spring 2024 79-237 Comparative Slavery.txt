Course Description: This course will examines the pervasive, world-spanning institution of human slavery. Although the time frame this course deals with is  broad -  from the rise of complex societies in the ancient world to slavery-like labor systems in the modern era - this class will focus more thoroughly on a few case studies, especially slavery in the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa, the US, and the Caribbean. These disparate examples will be related to a number of core themes, including race, class, family, gender, religion, national identity and underdevelopment.
