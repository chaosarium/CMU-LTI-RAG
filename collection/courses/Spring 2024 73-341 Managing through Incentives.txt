Aligning the objectives of workers, managers, and owners by providing them with appropriate incentives becomes an emerging paradigm in the modern business world. In this course, we learn how to reason about incentives between managers and employees, between managers and owners, and within a team of co-workers. We cover a broad range of topics including objective and subjective performance measurements, relative performance evaluations, relational contracts, and executive compensation. The course relies on business case discussions, rigorous theoretical material, and numerous class activities.    (Lecture, 3 hours).
