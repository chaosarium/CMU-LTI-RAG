Course Description: Game Studio: Real Time 3D is a hands-on intermediate course focused on immersive environments, world building, character creation, and real time experiences at the boundaries of gaming. On a conceptual level we'll look at practices within digital art and independent game development: virtual architecture and sculpture, walking simulators, avatar-based performances, and other playable media. On a technical level the course will introduce you to 3D modeling for real time applications (using Blender) and game engine workflows (using Unity) as a scaffolding for advanced courses. Students will work individually. Experience with game engines and 3D modeling is not required.
