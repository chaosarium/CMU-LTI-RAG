Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: Different from "Elementary Chinese I", this 9-unit Chinese language course is geared towards the needs of Chinese heritage students who have basic prior exposure to Chinese and with the intention to improve their Chinese literacy skills and Chinese culture awareness. This course helps students to better develop their daily reading and writing competence through a balanced and systematic training. By adopting the multimedia teaching materials, including language textbooks and culture-oriented audio and video English materials, this course will have an equal emphasis on both Chinese language and Chinese American historical events and culture. This course is intended to promote the students' cross-cultural knowledge and identity awareness. Students will be assessed in terms of their Chinese listening, speaking, reading and writing skills at the elementary level as well as their understanding of the Chinese American history and culture corresponding to their background. This course is taught in both Chinese and English.
