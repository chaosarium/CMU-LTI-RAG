Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: This seven-week course focuses on the fundamentals of computer programming using the Python 3 interpreted programming language. Students will develop their problem-solving skills using the top-down procedural decomposition approach to build real-world based software applications. Pupils will also learn the basics of the software development lifecycle: planning, development, testing, implementation and maintenance. Assignments will include weekly homework and bi-weekly fundamental checkpoint quizzes, top-down approach programming projects within a capstone object-oriented data focused project. Learners will study how to build professional, user-friendly computer programs applicable to realworld applications in an IT-modeled environment.  Students who complete 95-888 should not go on to take 90-812 Introduction to Programming with Python or 90-819 Intermediate Programming with Python.  If you have already completed 90-812 or 90-819, you should not register for this course.
