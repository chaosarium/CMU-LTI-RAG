Course Description: The goal of this course is to increase students internal resources for meeting stress through mindfulness-based meditation training. Each week, students will be trained in formal mindfulness meditation practices and asked to meditate at home with the help of brief guided meditation recordings. Students will also be given weekly informal mindfulness practice suggestions to help them translate the skills of formal meditation practice into daily life. Class meetings will give students the weekly opportunity for reflection, discussion, and questions based on their experience of formal and informal practice assignments.
