Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: This course is a continuation of Introduction to Conducting. The course offers a more detailed conducting technique, adding those subjects related to choral conducting. This is followed by the study and the analysis of interpretation from the point of view of the conductor and ends stressing a set of important practical items, including the psychological attitude and the leadership a conductor must develop as well as the organization and achievement of a fruitful rehearsal technique. The students work periodically with a pianist, a soloist or a chamber ensemble on traditional works and on their own compositions in the case of composition majors.
