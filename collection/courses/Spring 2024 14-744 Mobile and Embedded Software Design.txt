Course Description: Designing software for mobile and embedded devices is different from traditional software design. In this course, students will work with embedded devices to: consider hardware constraints in software design; explore the potential value and limitations of sensor data; assess user needs to create useful products or services; and prototype applications using sensors on embedded systems. Unlike a conventional hardware course, this course focuses on the design of application and service software. Low-level details of the processor architecture, embedded operating system, and firmware will not be addressed.
