Course Description: Systems Analysis: Environmental Policy provides an introduction to how environmental policies have been and can be designed/created, implemented, and evaluated amidst complex information-based, social, political, and cultural processes. The course emphasizes a systems-based methodological approach for addressing the complexities involved in framing, analyzing, and designing an implementation plan for policy construction.   The course also explores through landmark and contemporary case studies several dimensions of environmental policy-making: - Contextual, historical, and structural aspects of environmental policy-making at the local, state, federal, and international levels - Use of quantitative and qualitative analytical tools (from core program + new tools) - The process of how policies derive their meanings.
