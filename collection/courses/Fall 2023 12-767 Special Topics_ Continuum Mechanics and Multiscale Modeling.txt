Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: This course will begin with the foundations of continuum mechanics, introducing tensors, and then discussing kinematics, balance laws, and constitutive modeling. Building on those foundations, the class will survey advanced topics in multiscale modeling. These topics will include a selection from composites and homogenization; wave propagation and metamaterials; electromechanics and chemomechanics; mechanics of polymers; fracture mechanics; phase-field modeling; and relevant topics in mathematics. Selected topics may be discussed in depth based on student interest.
