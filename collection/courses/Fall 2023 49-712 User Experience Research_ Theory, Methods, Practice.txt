Course Description: This course guides students through determining the need for research, planning and executing several iterations of user engagements with different UX research methods, analysis of data and development of a report. The course is focused primarily on qualitative data, although some time is spent to source quantitative data and leverage a mixed approach. The course is a mix of lectures, discussions and activities in class as well as an independent project. Readings are provided in addition to a course handbook created by the instructor. This is a required course for the MIIPS degree program. All others must contact the instructor for permission.
