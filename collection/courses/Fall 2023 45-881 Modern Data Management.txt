Course Description: The objective of this course is to learn how to organize and manipulate data for making critical business decisions. "Data Management" in this course includes both the analysis of various sizes and types of data and their synthesis into fact-based, data-driven recommendations with illustrating charts. The course teaches the use of advanced functions in Excel (e.g., Pivot tables, look-up functions, array formulas), the abstraction and representation of business situations as entity relationship diagrams, the transformation of such diagrams into database schemata, and the use of Structured Query Language to manipulate data. We will use MS Access as our database software. The course also includes hands-on experience with cloud-based databases.
