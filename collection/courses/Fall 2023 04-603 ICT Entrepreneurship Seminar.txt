Course Description: In this course, we define an entrepreneur as someone engaged in the development of a new product (and perhaps, but not necessarily, also a new venture) under conditions of extreme uncertainty. Entrepreneurship is a key part of an economy's search for new solutions that increase customer value. Why is it a search? Because, when the conditions surrounding a contemplated new product are uncertain, the answers to key questions are not known apriori. What features are actually needed? Does the product or service  in fact solve the problem we think it does for the users? Are they willing to pay enough for the product to make bringing it to market profitable? Ultimately, entrepreneurship is a critical part of the growth engine that improves a society's standard of living. In this course we look at how to facilitate this searching process and hopefully maximize the chance of bringing a successful new product to market.  Students learn to think more deeply about how markets operate, what creates value, and how to investigate an idea in an environment characterized by risk and the need to be profitable. In other words, they learn to think like an entrepreneur. They gain an appreciation for entrepreneurship as just one part, albeit an important one, of the entire economy. They hear first-hand from multiple entrepreneurs and learn about their personal experiences and lessons learned.
