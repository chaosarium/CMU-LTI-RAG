Course Description: Television has become a constant in our lives.  The variety of unique voices has produced some of the best storytelling in decades. Some critics have stated that television is going through a renewed golden age.  The explosion of U.S. scripted content has increased the appetite for original stories both domestically and internationally.  In addition, the expansion of streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon have further expanded the global content market. As U.S. networks and distributors seek content, more opportunities for new voices and new points of view are welcomed.  This introductory class will focus on the fundamentals of writing for television with an emphasis on pitching and writing a television pilot. In addition to covering style and format, emphasis will be given to story ideas, outlines, structure, and marketability.
