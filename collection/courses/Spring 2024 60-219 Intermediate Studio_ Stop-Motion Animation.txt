Course Description: This intermediate animation studio explores principles and techniques of stop-motion animation.  Students will explore a range of materials and methods through hands-on animation studio practice.  Coursework emphasizes creative content production, experimentation, critical thinking, and collaboration.  Pioneering works of historical avant-garde animation inform exercises and project prompts, drawing upon rich global histories and a wide spectrum of practitioners.  A combination of rigorous studio practice, historical exposition, and theoretical discourse will equip students with the practical techniques and critical tools required to advance new dimensions in stop-motion animation.  Studio work emphasizes collective productions that engage the principles of animation, material sensitivities, and expressive puppetry performance.  Historical and theoretical examples guide coursework and class discussion. Screenings, practical tutorials, readings and discussions, will expose students to historical frameworks and contemporary currents in stop-motion animation, equipping students with a variety of conceptual, methodological, and technical resources.
