Course Description: It is difficult to go on a life long journey without a plan or map. In the "Design your life" micro-course, students take on the most important design project: their own life. Students explore who they are, where they come from, and where they hope to go throughout their life. They describe their core values, what makes their life meaningful, and whom they hope to become in the future. While one's life is very personal, we use time-tested design methods to explore each person's future. We explore readings from: (1) George Lowenstein's Mattering Maps, (2) Elle Luna's "The Crossroads of Should and Must: Find and Follow Your Passion"; (3) Bill Burnett and Dave Evans approach to "Designing Your Life: How to Build a Well-Lived, Joyful Life"; (4) Verne Verne Wheelwright's person futures approach "It's YOUR Future...: Make it a Good One!", and Tony Fry's "Ontological Design". By the end of the micro-course each student will have made a plan for their future. The will be able to explain what matters to them and have charted a way forward. Most importantly, they will know how to rechart their life plans as unexpected events require them to adapt their plans.
