Course Description: This course uses mathematical approaches to develop models for chemical systems and materials from the bottom up, i.e. from atoms and molecules to substances. This course focuses on statistical mechanics and does not cover quantum mechanics basics. Math will be covered in the context of chemical phenomena, and combine topics from probability theory and statistics, 3-dimensional calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra. 3 hrs. lec.
