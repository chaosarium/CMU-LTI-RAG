Course Description: We equip students with creative engineering problem-solving techniques and fundamental chemical engineering material balance skills. Lectures are designed to provide training in data analysis, material property estimation for single- and multi-phase systems, basic process flow-sheets, reactive and non-reactive mass balances, along with problem solving strategies and tools applied to biomanufacturing and other topics of interest in pharmaceutical processing. This course is intended for graduate students in the physical sciences that lack an engineering background.
