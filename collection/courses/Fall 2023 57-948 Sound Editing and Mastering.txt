Course Description: The raw recording is just the first step in the process of creating a professional finished audio product.  "Editing" is the art of piecing together different takes to make one final 'good take.'  "Mastering" is the art of polishing the 'good take' to perfection--balancing all the instruments and tracks, adding special effects, setting final levels.  If 'recording' seems like an high-energy activity--involving engineers, musicians, producers--'editing and mastering' are the necessary counterparts--long tedious hours of solitary confinement honing the skills of the mastering engineer.  Those taking this course are expected to have significant music skills: actively playing a musical instrument (or composition), and/or the ability to read a piano score at the least, and a full orchestra score from any recent century, including our own, at the most.
