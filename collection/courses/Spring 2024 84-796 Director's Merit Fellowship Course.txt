Course Description: This 1-unit P/NP course is required for CMIST Graduate Students who received a Director's Merit Fellowship upon admission to their program. Fellows are assigned either a Teaching Assistant or Research Assistant each semester of graduate enrollment and should prepare to work 10 hours/week towards their assignment. Fellows are expected to participate in a half-day orientation workshop at the beginning of their fellowship and then coordinate expectations and deliverables with their faculty supervisors each semester.  Faculty will assign mid-term and final grades; fellowships for the following semester will be re-assessed if a "NP" grade is issued.
