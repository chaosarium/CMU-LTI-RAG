Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: The aim of this course is to teach students how to develop educational goals based on a detailed task analysis of the knowledge, skills, and dispositions required for mastery of a particular aspect of a domain. Goals for early childhood, elementary, middle school, high school, postsecondary, and adult education will be discussed and related to relevant state, national, and international standards. A comprehensive understanding of student achievement will be developed. The importance of matching the instructional program and its assessment to goals will be discussed and demonstrated. Assessment that focuses on covering the full range of specified goals will be studied along with diverse approaches for valid assessment. Other topics include making instructional material choices, funding, classroom management, ethics, schools, and social systems. Assignments will emphasize linking goals - instruction - assessment. A term project will consist of an in-depth study of one central unit in a discipline or grade level. Undergraduates are invited to take this course with special permission from Dr. Lauren Herckis.
