Course Description: Dalcroze Eurhythmics is a unique approach to music learning based on the recognition that meaningful rhythmic movement experience, associated with ear-training and improvisation, reinforces understanding of music concepts, enhances musicianship, and focuses awareness on the physical demands of artistic performance. All concepts are experienced in a musical context. Rhythm reading, notation, analysis, and improvisation are integral to the course. Eurhythmics I covers basic binary and ternary metric units and rhythm patterns in relation to these metric units within simple and compound meters.
