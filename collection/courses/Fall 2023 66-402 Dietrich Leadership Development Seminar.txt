Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: The Dietrich Leadership Development Seminar is for juniors and seniors in Dietrich College wishing to advance their understanding of leadership theory and practice and to develop their own skills in this regard, while creating a context for their lifelong leadership development.  The course is predicated on a six pillar model proposing that ideal leaders must at once be visionary, ethical, engaging, tactical, technical - including sub-expert conversancy in realms beyond their own expertise, and reflective - including both personal mindfulness and assessment against clear metrics.  In this context, the course includes a focus on strategic planning, teamwork, cultural awareness, conflict resolution, risk management, sustainability and personal welfare, professionalism, personal financial planning, and ongoing professional development. The course includes an attendance requirement and active engagement in class discussion, assigned readings/videos/podcasts (2 hours/week), self-selected experiential opportunities (2 hours/week), reflective journaling (2 hours/week), three hour-long one:ones per semester with the instructor, special guests who are leaders in various occupational and service domains, a mid-term, a final, and a final presentation.  The course includes case studies and role plays to amplify the learning experience.  The course is limited to twelve students, with registration based on approval of the faculty member.
