Course Description: When you write your television pilot, you are crafting the engine that will generate year after year of stories. The opening image makes clear that this is a show like no other, the show only you could create. The first ten minutes set the bomb that's going to blow up your hero's world. Your pilot as a whole lets us know what we can expect here every week, with our new family, as they look for a way to get through this thing. In this class, we will meet and master the elements of the television pilot, then use them to build a marketable script. We will devote ourselves extensively to practicing the habit of revision.
