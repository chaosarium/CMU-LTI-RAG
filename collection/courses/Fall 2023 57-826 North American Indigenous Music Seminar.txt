Course Description: This course examines diverse Indigenous musical practices in North America, including powwow, round dance, intertribal flute music, and Inuit vocal games. We highlight the heterogeneity of Indigenous musical culture both within specific practices and through the frequent engagement with non-Indigenous musical genres, such as the symphony, ballet, string quartet, and dubstep. This course pursues the understanding of diverse Indigenous musical practices through the lens of historical, socio-cultural Indigenous issues, such as cultural genocide and residential schools, sovereignty, identity, and decolonization.   (This course can count as music support for graduate students. Undergraduate students may register with instructor permission if space is available after graduate students have registered.)
