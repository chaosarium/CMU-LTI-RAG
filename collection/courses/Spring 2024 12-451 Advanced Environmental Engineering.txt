Course Description: Building on fundamental concepts from 12-221, 12-351, and 12-353, this course focuses on the physical, chemical, and biological processes controlling the quality of water, soil, air -- and ultimately human and ecosystem health. Students will learn how these processes regulate the cycling of contaminants and nutrients in the environment. Key topics include material and energy balances, advective-dispersive transport with reacting solutes, and partitioning of contaminants and nutrients across different media.  Students will also gain familiarity with (1) how regulatory agencies and decision-makers account for these processes in environmental protection efforts and (2) related challenges and opportunities around climate change.
