Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: ART WRITER will strive to bring together the intersecting discourses of artists' use of writing as an object, exploring experiments by artists, poets, novelists and critics who use language and theory as invention. The idea of experiment implied here emphasizes the urgency that art writing moves beyond its own history, beyond the received understanding of its proper practices in order to propose new modes of critical reflection. The form and material force of language will be explored through the conceptual and critical work of Harryette Mullen, Fatimah Asghar, Jamaica Kincaid, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Frances Stark, Kathy Acker, Samuel Delaney, Trisha Low, Glenn Ligon, Brian Kim Stefans, Pajtim Statovci, Tan Lin, Adam Pendleton, just to name a few. International projects of Art and Language, Fluxus, the Dark Room Collective, Los Contempor√°neos, as well as more recent iterations will be investigated/researched. This is a writing intensive seminar with experimentation at its core. Members will workshop their writing: revise, rethink, perform, and publish.
