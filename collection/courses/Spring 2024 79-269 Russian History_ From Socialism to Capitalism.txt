Course Description: Beginning with Stalin's death in 1953, this course focuses on the efforts of a new group of Soviet leaders to eliminate the repression of the Stalin years and to create a more democratic socialism. It will examine the reforms of Khrushchev and the reaction against them, the long period of Brezhnev's rule, and the hopeful plans of Gorbachev. Finally, it will survey Gorbachev's loss of control, the collapse of socialism and the Soviet Union, and the growth of "wild west" or "gangster" capitalism. We will look at the rise of the oligarchs and the impact of the capitalist transition on ordinary people. The course provides essential background for anyone interested in understanding Russia's place in the world today and its relationship with the West.  This course fulfills Dietrich College's "Intercultural and Global Inquiry" general education requirement.
