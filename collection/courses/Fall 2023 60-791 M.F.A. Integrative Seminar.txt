Course Description: Integrative seminar is designed as a group critique course involving the entire graduate cohort, and functions as the collective discussion surrounding each student's individual practice. An anchor within the program, the group critique sessions integrate the discourses of academic seminars, individual studio practices, and visiting artists to function as a weekly forum where the progression of individual and group ideas evolve within a discursive environment. In order to expand the voices you hear we will periodically be including visiting artists, curators, critics and other faculty members as participants in the seminar. School of Art MFA students only.
