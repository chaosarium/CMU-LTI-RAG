Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: The Concerto, one of the most popular forms of music, is also a dramatic form, a drama of contrast between the strength of one body of sound and another (volume), between one type of sound and another (tonal distinction), between the individual and the masses, and finally, between the "Solo" virtuoso and the less gifted "Tutti" players.     The goal of this course is to examine the greatest concerti written for all instruments; from Vivaldi's "Concerto for Two Mandolins" to John Adams's "Grand Pianola Music," and much more, while dealing with the social and personal histories of unforgettable virtuosi and the concerti that became their "Battle Horses."    The program analyzes great concerti performed by the world's greatest soloists and orchestras.
