Course Description: This course is meant to serve as an introduction to the craft of poetry. We'll look closely at traditional forms in an effort to understand the effects of more formal choices on the page, and we'll examine the craft choices of modern and contemporary poets to expand our understanding of poetic approaches. Our analysis of poetry will begin at the level of the syllable and progress to words, lines, stanzas, series, and collections. You will be required to read both published work and the work of your classmates with a critical eye, to write your own poems, both formal and not, to write several short analysis essays, to write a longer critical essay, and to demonstrate your knowledge on one in-class exam. The most important take-away from this class is the ability to talk knowledgeably and critically about poetry. What you learn here will pave the way for your future as both a writer and a reader.
