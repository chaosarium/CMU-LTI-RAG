Course Description: Product managers are essentially the "CEO" of the product line. Brand and product management provides strategic vision and leadership for the product and service, both 1) understanding the market opportunity and what must be done for successfully delivering on the brand promise and 2) leading across the organization, often without authority, to achieve that success.  Product/service success in a dynamic market is subject to many factors, including marketplace needs, reactions and activities of competition, the strategy and change within one's own firm, operating and financial constraints, demand forecast uncertainty, and more.  By taking this course, you will learn the principles of product and brand management and understand what it is like and what it takes to be a successful marketing leader.
