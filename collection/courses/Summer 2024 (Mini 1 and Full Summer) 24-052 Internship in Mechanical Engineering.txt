Course Description: The Department of Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon considers experiential learning opportunities important educational options for its undergraduate students. One such option is an internship, normally completed during the summer. Students do not need to officially register for an internship unless they want it listed on their official transcripts. The Mechanical Engineering Department will add the course to the student's schedule, and the student will be assessed tuition for 3 units. Upon completion of the internship, students must submit a 1-2 page report of their work experience, and a 1-2 page evaluation from the company supervisor to the Academic Advisor's Office. After the reports have been reviewed and approved, a "P" grade will be assigned. This process should be used by international students interested in Curricular Practical Training (CPT) International students should also be authorized by the Office of International Education (OIE). More information regarding CPT is available on OIE's website.
