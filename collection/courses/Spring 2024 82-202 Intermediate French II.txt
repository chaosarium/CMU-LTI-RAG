Course Description: At the intermediate level, students will continue to improve listening, speaking, reading and writing skills with the goal of becoming more proficient in daily and extended communication needs. In addition to an ongoing review of basic grammar, a greater variety of grammar, expressions and complicated sentence structures will be taught so that students can carry on more sophisticated conversations on various topics. In-class activities and homework using authentic texts related to the broad spectrum of French and francophone cultures will be used to integrate language learning with content and culture. Regular homework, quizzes, tests, presentations, essays, and class participation are mandatory. A student with prior experience in French must take the placement exam.
