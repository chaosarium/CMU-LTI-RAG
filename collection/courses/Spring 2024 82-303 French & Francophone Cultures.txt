Course Description: Through deep cultural analyses of France and francophone spaces, students uncover the roots of the French mentality and how this mentality oftentimes clashes with 'francophone', which is to say 'French', citizens who remain the 'Other' even in the 21st century. Comparisons between past and current events in French and francophone histories explain in part the French mentality and why the French react to the world as they do, resulting in the ongoing challenges of integration and identity of citizens from former colonies. Students will address questions such as: "What is preventing full integration?" and "How can integration be successful?" or "Is integration desirable?" The coursework will develop students' skills in writing, reading, speaking, and listening, and improve their control of grammar through class discussions, presentations, and essays. This course is repeatable with new topics.
