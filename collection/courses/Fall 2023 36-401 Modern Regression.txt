Course Description: This course is an introduction to the real world of statistics and data analysis using linear regression modeling. We will explore real data sets, examine various models for the data, assess the validity of their assumptions, and determine which conclusions we can make (if any). We will use the R programming language to implement our analyses and produce graphs and tables of results. Data analysis is a bit of an art; there may be several valid approaches. We will strongly emphasize the importance of critical thinking about the data and the question of interest. Our overall goal is to use data and a basic set of modeling tools to answer substantive questions, and to present the results in a scientific report.
