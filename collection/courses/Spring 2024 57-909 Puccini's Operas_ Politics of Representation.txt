Course Description: Standing between the 19th and 20th Centuries, Puccini witnessed extraordinary socio-political and cultural shifts sweeping across Europe. His operas reflect such changes through their gradual stylistic adherence to modernity.  From theatrical and literary plots to complex relationships with poets, publishers, impresarios, singers, conductors, and political censors, Puccini's operas offer excellent grounds for interdisciplinary dialogue and cultural analysis.
