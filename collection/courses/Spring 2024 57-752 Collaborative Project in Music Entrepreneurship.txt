Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: The project for Spring 2024 is to continue the Scottie Sound Bath pilot program that was launched in Fall 2023 and make it sustainable as an in-house student-run program at CMU that uses sound and music to reduce anxiety and improve mental health. We will continue our partnership with Athletics and Student Affairs. Outcomes will be measured and additional research studies will be designed. Students will learn about the science of sound vibration as well as ancient practices for using sound for healing.  We will also explore business opportunities for those wishing to establish new revenue streams in this rapidly emerging field. Any CMU student interested in sound healing is welcome to join this class.This is an advanced entrepreneurship course and requires a solid foundation of project management and interpersonal skills. Class size is limited to a team of 8 self-driven students. A high level of personal initiative and professionalism is required.
