Course Description: Intermediate Spanish I is the first part of a two-semester course sequence (82-241, 82-242) designed to familiarize students with the cultures and perspectives of the Spanish-speaking world. Students will develop self-expression across a range of culturally significant topics, improving their speaking, listening, reading, and writing skills while working with longer passages of language in context through reading, writing and listening/viewing (e.g. tv series, movies, short novels, plays) and frequently working in groups and pairs, and utilizing technologies that enhance learning opportunities and promote skill development. The course provides extracurricular opportunities to interact with members of the Spanish-speaking community.
