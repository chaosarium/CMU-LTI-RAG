Course Description: This course is designed to introduce students to the basics of Islamic Finance.  The course will start with an analysis of the Shariah rules that define Islamic Finance.

The course wraps up with a critique of complex project finance structures through a Shariah compliance lens to identify the gaps between theory and practice.
