Course Description: Is self-producing for you, or do you prefer to use other people's resources? Basics of Producing for Theater Artists will introduce the mechanics of getting your work to the spectator while creating a sustainable life as an artist. We'll investigate old models and new platforms to help you find the location and the recipe for your unique mission. We will walk through budgeting, fundraising, marketing, contracts, rights, risks, and the audience of the future. As a final project, you will assemble a package you can hand to a potential funder that explains why your theater is needed to fill a void in the culture, and why no one is better suited to do it.
