Course Description: This course spans the first six weeks of 33-211, Physics III: Modern Essentials and should not be taking by students intending to major in physics. It treats the mechanics aspects of special relativity, including topics such as simultaneity, the Lorentz transformation, time dilation, length contraction, space-time geometry, resolving some famous puzzles, and the momentum, mass, and energy relations. The Electricity and Magnetism portions of the subject are deferred until the junior/senior courses in E&M; (33-338/33-339). Students may not take this class if they have successfully completed 33-211.
