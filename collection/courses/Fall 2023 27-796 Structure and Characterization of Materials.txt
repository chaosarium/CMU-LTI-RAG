Course Description: The objective of this course is for the student to be able to understand important crystal structures of both inorganic and organic materials in terms of their building blocks (atom positions, Bravais lattices, structural units, symmetry groups, stacking and packing configurations) and also to understand how modern experimental materials characterization techniques (including x-ray, electron, and neutron diffraction and spectroscopic techniques) are used to obtain structural and chemical information.
