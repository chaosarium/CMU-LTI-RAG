Course Description: The independent study course is appropriate to take for a learning activity that is neither covered by existing courses nor in independent research. At the ISR PhD.D level, students focus on formal coursework and independent research, so the independent study course is taken rarely. If students are interested in the possibility, you should speak with the faculty member who would guide you in the independent study, along with your prospective advisor(s).   The Independent Study should be a structured activity with an outcome that can be evaluated.  Students must fill out a SE PhD.D. Independent Study Prospectus prior to course registration.
