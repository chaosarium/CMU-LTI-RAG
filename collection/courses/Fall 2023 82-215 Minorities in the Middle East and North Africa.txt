Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: F23: Minorities in the Middle East and North Africa In today's society that explores Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), one ought to ponder if Arab societies have made progress to achieve DEI among groups of other religions (Muslims, Christians, Jews), sects (Sunni and Shi'a), ethnicities (Copts, Nubians, Kurds), Palestinians, LGBTQ, and women. Some of the questions that this course addresses are whether a minority in Arab societies is defined by number or status; the role of education, social norms, and media in approaching issues of skin colors and minorities' rights; the autocratic governments' use of identity politics to serve their own interests; and the historical changes that have shaped citizenship and belonging. This course aims to enrich students' understanding of the diversity of Arab countries and the impact of colonialism, Pan-Arabism, socio-economy, and cultural norms on minorities' status through readings, films/documentaries, music, and data collected via surveys and virtual sessions with students in Arab countries.
