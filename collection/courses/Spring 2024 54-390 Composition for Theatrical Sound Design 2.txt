Course Description: This course will concentrate on further developing compositional skills for use in theatrical sound design. The full length of this course is  designed to take place over two semesters. This is the second semester and builds on compositional techniques such as writing melody, harmony, counterpoint and orchestration techniques.  The second semester focuses particularly on more advanced skills in composition within a theatrical context. Through projects distributed throughout the semester students practice the skill-based techniques of music notation, orchestration, synthesis, sequencing, working with instrumentalists and the creation and utilization of sample-based instruments. This course will also cover textual analysis as it applies to both the inspiration for composition and to the more direct challenge of setting music to text.
