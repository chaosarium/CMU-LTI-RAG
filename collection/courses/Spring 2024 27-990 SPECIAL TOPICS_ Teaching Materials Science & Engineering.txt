Course Description: This course is designed to prepare graduate students for their future role as educators in Materials Science & Engineering.  Teaching is a critical facet of higher education whether as a course assistant, instructor, or student mentor.  Although excellent teaching can have a significant positive impact on students at all levels, formal training at the University level is relatively uncommon.  Contrary to popular belief, teaching is not simply a skill you are born with, but rather one that requires significant practice and continuous refinement.  The primary goal of this course is to provide pedagogical strategies necessary to be an effective teacher with a focus on fundamental topics in materials science & engineering.
