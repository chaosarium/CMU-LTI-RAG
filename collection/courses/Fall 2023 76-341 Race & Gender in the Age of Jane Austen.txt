Course Description: From Bridgerton (Netflix) to Sanditon (ITV), there is a current boom in Regency adaptations that practice "colorblind" or "color-conscious" casting while interrogating the period's gendered and racial dynamics. But how were race and gender, and their intersections, actually forged and navigated in the age of Austen? This 300-level course will look at Romantic-era in both a historical and a contemporary context. Through reading, viewing, and graded assignments including short essays and oral presentations, we will practice methods for analyzing the formal features of literary and visual texts, such as the structure of a novel, the rhythms of poetry, or the costuming of period drama. In doing so, we will ask: how do these texts respond to historical phenomena such as empire, the rights of women, and slavery and abolition? How and why do contemporary adaptations take up these questions? Examples of readings include Aphra Behn's Ooronoko, Jonathan Swift's "The Lady's Dressing Room," Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, Mary Prince's The History of Mary Prince, and William Wordsworth's "To Toussaint L'Ouverture."
