<start course description for 79-505 Internship: Social & Political History>
Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: The Social & Political History program strongly encourages students to locate internship opportunities in Pittsburgh or elsewhere that complement their historical interests (as, for example, in a museum or historical society) or in areas of policy research that complement their historical interests (as, for example, in a government agency or non-profit organization). To earn academic credit for their internship, students will be required to maintain a weekly journal; write a short critical reflection on how the internship connects to their academic interests; and share their experience with other Social & Political History majors. The Academic Advisor will assist students with matching their interests to local organizations. SPH students can earn up to 9 units in each internship. Please note, however, that internship credits (students may complete up to three internships) do not count toward fulfillment of course requirements for the SPH major (though the units do count toward graduation).
