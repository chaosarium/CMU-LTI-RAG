Course Description: Mechanics of Manipulation is a graduate level course that dives into the fundamentals of robotic manipulation. Through this course you will learn the kinematics, statics, and dynamics of robotic manipulators as they interact with the world to accomplish tasks. You will gain experience with the intelligent use of kinematic constraint, gravity, and frictional forces. Additional topics include rigid body mechanics, automatic planning based on mechanics, deformable manipulation, and simulation of dynamic manipulation. Applications of robotic manipulation are drawn from physical human-robot interaction, manufacturing, and other domains.
