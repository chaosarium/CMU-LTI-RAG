Course Description: A continuation of Improvisational Acting I, exercises build on previous course.  This course uses the craft of improvisational acting to foster team building and encourage students to overcome their inhibitions when working with others. In this course students will learn how to work together as an ensemble, how to develop a dramatic theme or idea, how to respond to moments of uncertainty on stage in a quick and confident manner, and how to increase the students' awareness of what takes place moment-to-moment on stage. This course will introduce and drill students in improvisational techniques and exercises that will enhance their abilities in performance. Students will learn the rules of improvisation, warm-ups, anti-editing, and the exploration of space and time. Students will commence with an exploration of C.R.O.W.,(i.e.,character-relationship-objective-and-where), followed by 'offers,' 'assumptions,' and 'give-and-take,' such as character storytelling and the furthering of space and time.
