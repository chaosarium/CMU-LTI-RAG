Course Description: This course will provide an opportunity for students to explore both the history and the contemporary perspective on issues like anti-semitism in America and American Jewry's relationship to the Zionist movement, Israel and American-Israeli relations today.  We will hear from several experts on these matters.  We will also consider the story of Jews in America--who they were, why they came, what happened when they got here, what responses they made to the challenges they faced including their response to the Holocaust.
