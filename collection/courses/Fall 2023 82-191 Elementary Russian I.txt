Course Description: This course is for students who have never studied Russian. It begins the Russian language sequence and is offered in the fall semester only. The course takes a communicative approach to teaching basic skills in listening, speaking, reading and writing. Language is presented in communicative contexts illustrating cultural aspects of daily Russian life. The elementary level is also designed to help students learn to reflect and draw upon strategies used by good language learners in their second language study. Daily homework and participation in class are mandatory (four in-class hours per week), as is weekly consultation and conversation practice with a course assistant. A student with prior experience in Russian must take the placement exam. **If you would like to take this course, but the current time slot does not work with your schedule please contact the instructor as soon as possible and we may be able to accommodate you**
