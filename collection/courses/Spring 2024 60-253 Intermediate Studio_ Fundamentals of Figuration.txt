Course Description: This studio-based figuration course is designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of the figure. This class will provide a solid understanding of how to begin working with the human form in space. Students will learn how to block out and establish the major structural masses of the body through gesture drawing. We will learn to look "through" the body, understanding its logical underpinnings through rigorous study of anatomy and physiology, both by lecture and observation. Students will work from the skeleton, draw and paint musculature, and spend extensive time working from the live model or models. Both dry and wet media are encouraged: graphite, charcoal, metal point, colored pencils, pastels, ink, watercolor and gouache can be openly explored in this course.
