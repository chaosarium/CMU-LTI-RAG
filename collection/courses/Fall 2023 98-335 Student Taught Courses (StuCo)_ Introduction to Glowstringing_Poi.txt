Course Description: Often seen in raves and music festivals, glowstringing is the art of dancing with glowsticks or other luminescent objects on a string by swinging them in the air, hitting them against your body, and performing other tricks and manipulations. In this StuCo, you can expect to learn many of the fundamentals of glowstringing, along with a simple choreography that you can use to put on a show for friends, family, or strangers.   Although this course is targeted towards beginners with no experience, people of all skill levels will have something to learn.  Class sessions are workshop-based but highly individualized. Everyone's learning pace is different and the pacing of the course will be adjusted based on overall learning speed of the class.
