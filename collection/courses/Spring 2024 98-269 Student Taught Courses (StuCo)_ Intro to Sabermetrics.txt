Course Description: Born in the 1970s and popularized by "Moneyball" as a radical challenge to traditional baseball statistics, sabermetrics has developed into a new way of understanding America's pastime. Its practitioners have created new statistical tools and revised our old ways of thinking about the game, transforming the way fans and Front Offices view and assess players. This introduction to the basics of sabermetrics will explain concepts including standardization, peak versus career performance, linear weights and runs created, as well as popular calculations such as OPS (OnBase plus Slugging), WHIP (Walks and Hits per Inning Pitched), PF (Park Factor), and others increasingly used by members of the sabermetrics community.
