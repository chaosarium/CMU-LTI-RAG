Course Description: This is a class of basic issues regarding hand bookbinding  and letterpress printing. It's purpose is to develop a basic  structural sense of book forms, of flat format work and of three  dimensional forms. Learning hand craft techniques, developing  hand skills and the sensitivity to materials are also a goal.  Binding projects assigned will target the unique nature of  papers, fabrics and archival card-boards. Structural procedures  and techniques will be identified with each assigned binding project.  The binding projects will be:  A hardcover for a paper back book,  a single signature book, a multi-signature book with flat spine,  and a box construction. The box project is designed and crafted  to contain a small letterpress printed class edition, either in book  form, or as a set of un-bound pages.  The letterpress component teaches the standard issues, unique  to the relief process, in press work, handset procedure of cast  metal type, page form spacing, lock-up of pages in press,  proofing, and production printing. Each semester a small class  edition project of text content and image, in two-color  registration, is designed, hand set and printed.  Image generation can be by hand cut block, assembled  type-high forms, or digital process to polymer plate.    This class is not to be repeated.
