Course Description: Is Post-humanism just another kind of humanism? Is the idea of difference at risk when thought is no longer attached to a body? What are the possibilities of imagining a queer phenomenology - or a transhumanism that challenges the limits placed on gendered, sexualized, racialized and so-called "able" bodies? How are our concepts of affect and authenticity being transformed by ideas of robotic and artificial intelligence? What are the various forms of subjectivities generated by machine-learning enabled media? How are constructions of "cheapfakes," "shallowfakes," and "deepfakes" posing ethical dilemmas in information and world-making landscapes? This seminar hopes to excavate such questions and many more produced by examining the competing and shared perspectives developed by contemporary artists and critical theorists across posthumanist, transhumanist and new materialist paradigms.
