<start course description for 54-381 Eco-drama>
Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: Every semester, members of the School of Drama's faculty offer seminars on special topics that investigate some aspect of theatre history, dramatic literature, dramatic theory, or a particular author, period, or genre. Like all Dramatic Literature classes, these are academically rigorous, requiring some amount of intensive critical reading and writing. SPECIAL TOPICS: ECODRAMA How are theatre artists responding to the challenges posed by climate change and the ecological and social crises it threatens to precipitate? This course will look at "ecodrama" - plays about the ecology and environment - and investigate historical and current approaches to putting the human relationship to the nonhuman world on stage and in performance.  Class activities will include reading and discussing plays as well as creating our own works of "ecodrama."
