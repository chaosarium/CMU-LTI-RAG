Course Description: The actors take a more concentrated approach to elevated text. The course focuses on the effective production of classical text. The warm up sessions are geared towards preparing the student actors for the extravagant language from Shakespeare?s plays and sonnets. Meter, imagery and further specific text work is also employed to encourage each student to find clear shape in the work. A repertoire of at least five classical monologues will come from the course work.
