Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: This introductory Borosilicate (hard glass) class will cover the basic skills needed to build a solid foundation as a flameworker. Safety, effective tool use, control of molten glass and manipulating it, and proper seal formation will be the focus. Begin with a solid rod of glass and walk away with solid glass miniature sculptures. From turtles and fish to birds and trees, create a menagerie of imaginative glass figurines. Bring your sketchpad to plan your ideas! Class tuition includes 2 hours of open-studio time to be used during the 8-week course period. This will help you become familiar with the studio itself and learn the process of studio rental beyond class hours.
