Course Description: IDeATe Special Topics in Animation: Story Development provides insight and strategy for animated storytelling in film and media production.  This mini- studio seminar draws upon diverse historical examples to highlight storytelling strategies across cultures and production paradigms.  Over this seven-week course, students will develop their own original stories in the forms of scripts and pitch packets, to be later produced as animated content.  Discussion and critique will cultivate storytelling skills with greater understanding for audience, form, and cultural context, providing essential tools for communication through animation.
