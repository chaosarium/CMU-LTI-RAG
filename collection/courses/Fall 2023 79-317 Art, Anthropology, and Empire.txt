Course Description: This seminar will explore the anthropology and history of aesthetic objects, as they travel from people and places sometimes labeled "primitive" or "exotic" to others, whose inhabitants deem themselves "civilized," "modern," or Western.  First, we will consider twentieth-century anthropological attempts to develop ways of appreciating and understanding objects from other cultures and in the process to reconsider the meaning of such terms as "art" and "aesthetics."  Then we will discuss several topics in the history of empire and exoticism. Finally, we will consider attempts by formerly colonized populations to reclaim objects from museums, and to organize new museums, aesthetic styles, and forms of artistic production that challenge imperialism's persistent legacies.
