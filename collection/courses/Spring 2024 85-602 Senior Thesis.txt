Course Description: This course is intended for senior Psychology or Cognitive Science majors who wish to conduct a research project under the direction of a faculty advisor.  The project topic is to be selected jointly by the student and the advisor.   The project will culminate in a senior paper which will be presented to the Department Head at the end of Fall Semester.  Prerequisite:  Grade of B or better in a previous research course required to enter, grade of B or better in first semester of senior thesis course required to complete, and permission of instructor.  A formal proposal is required in the first semester.  This course differs from the Honors Thesis sequence (66-501,602) in that it does not require Honors standing in HSS (i.e., there are no QPA requirements).  This course differs from Research in Psychology (85-507,508) in that the student's original contribution to the research is expected to be more substantial, and in that a final written report of the project is to be presented to the Department.
