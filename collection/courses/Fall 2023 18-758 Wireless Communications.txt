Course Description: In this course, the communication problem will be introduced, and channel impairments such as noise, inter-symbol interference and fading will be described. Solutions to combat these impairments, based on digital communication theory, will be described. These will include signal space analysis, detection, equalization, coding and diversity. Examples drawn from communication standards will illustrate how the theory is implemented in practical communication systems.
