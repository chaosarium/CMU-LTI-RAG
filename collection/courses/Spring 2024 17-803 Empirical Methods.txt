Course Description: This course provides an overview and hands on experience with a core of qualitative and quantitative empirical methods, including interviews, qualitative coding, survey design, and large-scale mining and analysis of data. We will mine and integrate data from and across online repositories such as Twitter, GitHub, and Stack Overflow, and employ a spectrum of data analysis techniques, ranging from statistical modeling to social network analysis. Each student will undertake a semester-long project based on their own research.
