Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: Have you ever felt that you liked an artwork but couldn't explain why? Do you have questions about art that you were always afraid to ask? This course is conceived to give students the tools to feel at home when visiting a museum and to talk about art in social, business and academic settings. It is organized over two semesters, but students can take only one of the two courses, or both, in any order they prefer. Cultural History of the Visual Arts -The Modern Period (offered in the spring) covers the period from the 1800s to the 2000s and features masterpieces and lesser-known works that define our idea of what art is and what role it has in society. Some of the topics we will study include the invention of a "modern" ways of seeing in Japanese art; the impact of science, film and photography on the Impressionists; the myth of the artist as a savage, a fool, and a prophet; the creation of ideal homes for common (and uncommon) people; the meaning of the avant-garde; and the many ways in which artists and politicians experiment with art and architecture in order to control our minds and emotions. The course also includes museum visits that will be organized in relation to the students' schedules. No prerequisite required and open to students from all disciplines.
