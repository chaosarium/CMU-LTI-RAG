Course Description: Video games are host to some of the most exciting (& hotly debated!) fictional romances of our time.  This course aims to introduce students to the origins, evolution, and modern video game romances across a multitude of generations, cultures, and mediums.  Topics include marriage mechanics and strategy, relevant character tropes, elements of a successful video game romance, as well as the ethical and practical limitations of romance as a story component.  In this discussion-based course, students will be pushed to converse these topics in an open & collaborative space. When is romance apropos in a game? How can it limit a game's potential? Simply still thinking about that video game crush you had as a kid. We'll discuss!  Classes will consist of lectures and group discussions. Assessments will tap into both students' creativity and ability to apply material discussed in lecture to their observations, as they explore instances of romance across the video game media of their choice. No prerequisite knowledge or materials required!
