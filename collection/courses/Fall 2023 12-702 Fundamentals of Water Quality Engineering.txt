Course Description: This course is a systematic overview of water quality engineering designed for students with no prior civil and environmental engineering background.  Topics examined include physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of water; common water pollutants; basic water chemistry and micriobiology; mass and energy balances and their use in reactor analysis; physical, chemical and biological processes affecting natural water quality and the use of these processes in water supply and wastewater management systems; and selected problems in surface water and groundwater quality management.  A background in college-level general chemistry, physics, calculus, and differential equations is assumed.
