Course Description: Photography and the Ephemeral is an interdisciplinary photography course designed for students of various disciplines interested in exploring the relationship between images and the ephemeral: things that last only a short moment in time. Throughout the semester students will explore different themes and ways to approach fleeting imagery through weekly presentations, discussions, assignments, and critiques. Projects range from photographing ephemeral subject matter to making photographs that themselves are ephemeral.Â  Students are encouraged to work in a variety of photographic media, and some projects will utilize the black-and-white darkroom.
