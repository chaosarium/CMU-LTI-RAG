Course Description: Shaping Environments is a design-research seminar that explores alternative material formations beyond our current petrochemical reality. Using digital environments and computational tools, such as photogrammetry, depth-map texture modeling, AI workflows, and 3D printing, we will experiment with shaping new hybrid material systems. Using resources, such as food and/or construction waste, our goal is to propose new material paradigms that embrace ecological thinking and environmental stewardship through physical prototyping.
