Course Description: This class analyzes the economics of e-commerce and technology. It will identify the critical features that differentiate the technology firms from traditional industries, and examine the implications for business strategy. The class will discuss topics such as network effects, switching costs, and platform markets. To complement the economic theory, we will also consider a case study of a firm each week. These have three aims: to provide applications for the concepts developed in the lectures; to inform you about different industries; and to help develop your written, rhetorical and presentation skills.  Minimum grade of "C" required in all economics pre-requisite courses.
