Course Description: This course will teach you the basic craft of photography from exposure of the negative through darkroom developing and printing to print finishing and presentation. Content includes student presentations, class discussions, shooting assignments, darkroom sessions and class critiques. We will concentrate not only on the technical aspects of photography, but also the aesthetics of seeing with a camera. The course concentrates on photography as a fine art -- what is unique to it and the concerns that are shared with other visual arts, such as composition, tonal values, etc. and aims to equip students with an understanding of the formal issues and the expressive potentials of the medium.   Description addendum for section B, REMOTE ONLY: This virtual studio course explores all of the topics described above but does so within a digital framework. Students will learn the theory of analog monochrome photography without using a physical darkroom, incorporating modern digital imaging systems into a traditionally-informed practice.
