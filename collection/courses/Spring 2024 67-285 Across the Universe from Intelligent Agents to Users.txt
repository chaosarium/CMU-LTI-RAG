Course Description: The goal of this course is to introduce students to how intelligent agents and similar systems impact and are perceived by users. In this course, we explore different dimensions relating to intelligent agents' design, usability, and user perceptions such as humanness, trust, privacy, bias, human values, emotions, and so on. To do so, we review research articles at the intersection of Information Systems, Psychology and Artificial Intelligence. The course aims to introduce students to the research process and equip them with the necessary tools to design and explore research questions that address pressing issues in the realm of user-agent interaction.
