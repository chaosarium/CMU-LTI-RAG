Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: This course is designed as a first course in feedback control systems  for computer science majors. Course topics include classical linear  control theory (differential equations, Laplace transforms, feedback  control), linear state-space methods (controllability/observability,  pole placement, LQR), nonlinear systems theory, and an introduction  to control using computer learning techniques.  Priorities will be given to computer science majors with a robotics major or minor.
