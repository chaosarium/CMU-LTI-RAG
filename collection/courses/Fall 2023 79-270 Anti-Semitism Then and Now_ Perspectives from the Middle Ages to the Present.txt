<start course description for 79-270 Anti-Semitism Then and Now: Perspectives from the Middle Ages to the Present>
Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: This course will examine the history of anti-Jewish hatred and violence from the Middle Ages through the present. The course will focus on representative case studies, texts, and films. These will include pre-modern incidents of "fake news" such as the medieval rumor of "blood libel" that unleashed massacres and mass expulsions of Jews from countless communities. In examining the rise of modern anti-Semitism, we shall focus on debates over Jewish assimilation and citizenship and consider the popular impact of the print media's dissemination of conspiracy theories of Jewish world domination, including the infamous forgery, "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion." We will also examine cases of mass anti-Jewish violence, known as pogroms, in Eastern Europe and Russia, and the genocidal onslaught against European Jewry by the National Socialist regime. Finally, we will discuss the contemporary global resurgence of anti-Semitism.
