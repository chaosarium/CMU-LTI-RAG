Course Description: Symphonies of Johannes Brahms are the monumental master works of music.  In this course, the first symphony of Brahms will be thoroughly analyzed. All aspects of this work (haronic progression, form, orchestration, rhythm, and phrasing) will be examined and discussed.   Because of the extreme complexity of Brahms? music, a strong background in harmony, chord progression and voice leading as well as a strong background in musical forms, especially sonata form, are required for taking this course.  This is a ?studio? course. The class will be divided into four sections of three or four students per section.  Each section will meet with the instructor individually for one hour per week.  This course can count as music support for graduate students (and undergraduate students).  Undergraduate students may register with instructor permission if space is available after graduate students have registered.
