Course Description: Dramaturgical work in a theatre company extends far beyond individual productions. In this course students get hands-on practice in season planning, writing fundraising text, writing marketing text, and public speaking - all responsibilities that are typically but less visibly part of a dramaturg's job description. This course provides good grounding for a future in artistic leadership. Required for dramaturgy and directing majors; open to non-majors with instructor permission.
