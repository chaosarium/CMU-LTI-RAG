Course Description: This small discussion course traces ideas about individualism and capitalism in the U.S., from colonial times to the present. We will focus on three main themes: 1) the relationship between capitalism, work, and identity; 2) changing definitions of success and failure; and 3) the historical origins of students' attitudes toward 1 & 2. In short, we will study the economics and emotions of the American dream: how class, race, gender, occupation, and ambition shape our identities. Readings include "The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin," poems by the enslaved writer Phillis Wheatley, studies by Alexis de Tocqueville and Max Weber, writings of Frederick Douglass, Henry David Thoreau, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Andrew Carnegie's classic essay "Gospel of Wealth," an essay by Malcolm Gladwell, Arthur Miller's "Death of a Salesman," and Sarah Lewis's "The Rise," a book about failure and ambition. Grading is based upon a readings journal, participation in discussion, three short essays and a longer final paper.
