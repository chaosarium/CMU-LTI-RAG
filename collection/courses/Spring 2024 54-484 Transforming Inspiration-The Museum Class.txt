Course Description: In this class we will go from inspiration to a fully realized half scale sustainable costume design as a tool for the interpretation of a renowned artwork and as an intrinsic element of art history. Designers will investigate the proscenium of the painted frame and be provided with the freedom to interpret a specific painting from the Frick Collection. Field trips to the Frick along with docent research and presentation will bring new insight to the artwork and artist. This will offer students the opportunity to produce a thoughtful, passionate, fantastical or a theatrical imagining of its narrative through a designer's statement and the creation of costume using unconventional, recycled, or upcycled materials. Within the context of this class project and exploration of alternative fabrication and construction, students may design and create a costume that is a wild interpretation of a silhouette that is authentic and true to the period, a conflicted and contradictory costume inspiring a deeper view, or a subtle costume that investigates the real lives of the world depicted in this painting. Students are commended to employ a great deal of freedom to interpret and bring to life selected artwork a through the lens of costume design in a sustainable and thoughtful way. Final designs will be on display at the Frick.
