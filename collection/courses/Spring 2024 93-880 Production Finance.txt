Course Description: Accounting is a foundation to many businesses' enterprises and in the realm of film or TV, the Production Accountant is pivotal in overseeing and reporting on all production-related finances.

Central to the curriculum is the application of ethical decision-making in financial matters by both the accountant and the studio's production finance executive. To ensure relevance and clarity, we'll use real-world entertainment accounting scenarios as examples. Key areas of exploration include the roles and responsibilities within the production office, distinct phases of production, budgeting, payroll management, cost forecasting, and a day in the life of a production accountant and finance executive.
