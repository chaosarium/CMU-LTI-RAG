Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: The Alexander Technique is a dynamic and powerful process of education that gives us a practical knowledge of simple yet profound principles which govern human co-ordination. This process teaches us to observe and experience how we approach our lives, both physically and mentally. The technique enables us to recognize and release patterns of tension by redirecting excessive effort into useful energy, resulting in improved balance, flexibility and co-ordination. We learn how to transform tension into attention, fatigue into kinesthetic lightness. Through observation, discussion, functional anatomy, and gentle hands-on guidance, we regain deep structural support and experience a sense of freedom and the sheer pleasure of movement.   This is a studio mini-course. One section meets during the first half of the semester; the other section meets during the second half of the semester. Each section can have 3-4 students. There is a $225.00 studio fee; it is non-refundable, in order for the fee to be as low as possible.
