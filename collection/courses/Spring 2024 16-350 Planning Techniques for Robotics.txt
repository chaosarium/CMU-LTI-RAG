Course Description: Planning is one of the core components that enable robots to be autonomous. Robot planning is responsible for deciding in real-time what should the robot do next, how to do it, where should the robot move next and how to move there. This class does an in-depth study of popular planning techniques in robotics and examines their use in ground and aerial robots, humanoids, mobile manipulation platforms and multi-robot systems. The students learn the theory of these methods and also implement them in a series of programming-based projects.   To take the class students should have taken an Intro to Robotics class and have a good knowledge of programming and data structures.
