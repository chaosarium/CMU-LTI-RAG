<start course description for 57-339 Acting III>
Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: This course will build upon the foundation laid in the first year, with a more concentrated look at scene work, an audition workshop that focuses on cold readings as well as monologues, and a character-development project that works to identify specific issues that inhibit freedom on stage. More in-depth work on songs and arias will lead into a musical scene project. The semester will close with a classical text project in which the students will work with verse.
