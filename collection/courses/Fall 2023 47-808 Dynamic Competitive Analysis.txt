Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: This course will focus on the overlapping generations (OLG) model.  Together with the neoclassical growth model (aka the Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans model), the OLG is one of the workhorse models used in macroeconomic theory.  Since the student will have been introduced to the RCK model in detail in the first two macro classes, we will assume a working familiarity with this model and, as noted, focus primarily on the OLG model here.
