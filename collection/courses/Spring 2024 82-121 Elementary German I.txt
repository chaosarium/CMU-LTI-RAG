Course Description: This course is for students with no prior experience in German. Using a proficiency-oriented approach, students will develop contextually appropriate interpersonal communication skills in both written and spoken German, develop reading and listening skills through the use of various media, understand fundamental grammar, acquire vocabulary, and gain a basic understanding of German-speaking cultures through class activities. The elementary level is also designed to help students learn to reflect and draw upon strategies used by good language learners in their second language study. Regular homework, quizzes, tests, presentations, and class participation are mandatory (four in-class hours per week). A student with prior experience in German must take the placement exam.
