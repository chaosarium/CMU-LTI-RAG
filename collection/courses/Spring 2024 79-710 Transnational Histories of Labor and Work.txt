Course Description: This graduate seminar will consider how historians and other scholars are using transnational frameworks to shed new light (or not) on work and workers across cultural, ecological, and geopolitical boundaries.  We will place emphasis on thinking about work and workers in worlds that are simultaneously political and material. In so doing, we will engage with scholarly debates regarding the scope, scale, methods, and politics involved with doing border-crossing research.  The seminar will be structured to provide opportunities for participants to practice articulating their ideas in both oral and written forms, formal and less formal.  The seminar is intended to be useful to anyone interested in exploring paradigms for transnational research related to work or labor in history or other disciplines.  Key learning outcomes include (1) identifying and assessing central arguments via consideration of sources, theoretical frameworks, organization, and voice; (2) writing analytical essays of individual works and a set of related works; and (3) delivering clear oral presentations.
