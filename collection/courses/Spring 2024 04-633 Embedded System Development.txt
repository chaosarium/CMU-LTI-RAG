Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: This hands-on course provides a basic understanding of embedded systems development, embedded processor architectures, programming, and design. It covers models of computation for embedded systems, modeling, specification, synthesis, verification, hardware/software implementation, performance analysis, and optimization. Also covered are project design methodologies and associated tools.  Students will learn using chips such as the PIC and Arduino. Students will study assembly, C programming, and Arduino programming. Students will learn how to program with the embedded architecture that is ubiquitous in smartphones, portable gaming devices, robots, etc. Through a series of laboratory exercises with state-of-the-art embedded microcontrollers, sensors, and actuators, students will acquire skills in the design and implementation of core embedded systems.
