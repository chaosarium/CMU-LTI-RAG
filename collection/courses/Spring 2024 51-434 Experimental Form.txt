Course Description: The Experimental Form Studio looks broadly at the discipline of industrial design with an emphasis on creating new paradigms for interactive objects. This course encourages an exploratory study of physical objects and artifacts and provides a creative and intellectual forum to re-imagine our relationship with objects. Each independently-themed project presents opportunities to consider embedded mechanics and technology, objects as interactive media, and experience-driven design. Experimental Form, at its most basic, is a process that blends play and inquiry in an open-ended way finding the unexpected through tinkering and trying something you don't quite know how to do, guided by imagination, curiosity, and a disciplinary skillset. In this sense, Experimental Form complements the core Product Design Studio sequence by providing a playground for intellectual discourse, experimental trial and error, and refining individual processes for designing.
