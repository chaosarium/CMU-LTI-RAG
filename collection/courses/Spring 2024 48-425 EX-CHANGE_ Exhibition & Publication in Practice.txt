Course Description: Are you interested in exploring exhibition design, curating, or publishing as part of your practice? This course will give you hands-on experience, inviting you into the process of planning, designing, and curating the 2023 EX-CHANGE, an exhibition and publication that will be launched at the School of Architecture in fall 2023.  EX-CHANGE is the School of Architecture's annual exhibition and publication celebrating student work from first year to PhD. Inaugurated in 2017, EX-CHANGE represents an ongoing opportunity to shine new light on the SoA's programs and to position the work within larger questions of research and practice. Students will work alongside EX-CHANGE director Sarah Rafson and the professional design team who have been selected for the 2023 EX-CHANGE to get a glimpse into editorial and curatorial practice. This is an opportunity to play a role in shaping an exciting school-wide event.
