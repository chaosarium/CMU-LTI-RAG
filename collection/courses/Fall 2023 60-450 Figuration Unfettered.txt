Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: Figurative art retains aspects of the 'real' world as its subject matter.  It has recognizable forms; it shapes, makes likenesses, and represents. Typically, 2D figurative work creates illusionistic depth to create spaces in which narratives occur and are portrayed. Within this realm, our course is unrestrained. All of our observations are valid, stories equal, feelings freed, fears unleashed and proclamations promoted. Projects across painting and drawing are drawn from both perception and invention and include working from the live model. The class will consist of studio time, critique, readings, discussion and museum/gallery visits.
