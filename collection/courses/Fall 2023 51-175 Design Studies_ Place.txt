Course Description: "Place" introduces you to place-based design thinking. It trains your senses to perceive all that is designed and sustains everyday human lifestyles, especially those infrastructures and services invisible to city dwellers in the built environment. In addition, you will recognize relations between natural and artificial worlds. Coursework covers methods to evaluate individual and collective environmental and social impact at a regional and local level through techniques that develop capacities to reveal dynamic relationships among elements.
