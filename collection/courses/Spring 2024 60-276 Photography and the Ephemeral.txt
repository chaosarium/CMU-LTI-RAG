Course Description: Photography and the Ephemeral is an interdisciplinary photography course designed for students of various disciplines interested in exploring the relationship between images and the ephemeral: things that last only a short moment in time. Throughout the semester students will explore different themes and ways to approach ephemeral imagery such as; still lifes, installations, performances for the camera, and the short-lived nature of images both physical and digital. Participants explore these themes through weekly presentations, discussions, assignments, and critiques.
