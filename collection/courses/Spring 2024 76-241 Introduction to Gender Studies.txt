Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: Section A: This course offers an introduction to the study of gender, how we are gendered, and how systems of gendering form the architecture of the social world. With interdisciplinary readings both foundational and contemporary, the class will combine theory, literature, and film with legal texts, public policies, and media representations. We will take an intersectional approach, examining how gender converges with factors like race, class, sexual orientation, and disability to create distinct positions and multiple axes of oppression. Through reading, graded assignments, and class discussions, students will develop the ability to think critically about gender across disciplines and textual forms; to argue persuasively; and to express ideas clearly.
