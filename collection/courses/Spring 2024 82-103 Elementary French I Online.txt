Course Description: This course is designed for students with no prior experience with French and who need a more flexible approach to language learning than that offered in a standard classroom course. Beginning language learners will develop communicative competence in the four basic skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing. Basic vocabulary and sentence structures for use in essential daily-life situations, as well as cultural information, are taught through the course materials and assignments. Materials are web-based, with extensive use of Internet technologies for listening, reading, and communication. During regular semesters, this course is offered in a hybrid mode requiring one 80-minute class per week in addition to weekly 20-minute individual meetings with the instructor or a peer speaking  assistant. There is a materials fee for taking this course which is paid by credit card on first log-in to the course website. A student with prior experience in French must take the placement exam.
