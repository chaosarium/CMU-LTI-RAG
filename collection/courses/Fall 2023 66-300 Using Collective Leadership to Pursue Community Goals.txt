Course Description: This course serves as the third required course in the Dietrich College Community Engagement Fellowship. This course is designed to further prepare students to actively and thoughtfully engage alongside a community focusing on a topic of the students choice. This course will bring together prior topics of cultural humility, asset-based framing, cultural competence, and community-based leadership models alongside additional topics (such as collective leadership, tailored community-focused communication, among others) responsive to their community-based learning experiences. This will prepare students to narrow their focus on a topic and community in preparation for their capstone project.
