Course Description: This course helps design students formulate individual plans for their professional practice. In a ramp-up to Confluence, the first half of the class is devoted to developing and organizing portfolios, writing and designing resumes and cover letters and practicing interviewing skills. After Confluence, the second half is devoted to self-evaluation and reflection, guest lectures by early-career and later career designers and field trips that explore various aspects of a professional design career as well as other post-graduate opportunities. This course is geared towards Seniors and MA students, but Juniors applying for internships are also welcome.
