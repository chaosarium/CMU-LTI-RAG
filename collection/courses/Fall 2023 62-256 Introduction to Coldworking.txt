Course Description: Learn how to effectively use all of the cold shop's equipment, including belt sanders, flat grinders, dremels, polishers, etching lathes, the sandblaster, and the diamond saw. While completing several personalized projects, use the tools to create intricate patterns and surface textures. If you have no prior glass experience, glass materials will be provided for you. If you have work from other studios, you can use the cold shop tools to refine these pieces. Class tuition includes 2 hours of open-studio time to be used during the 8-week course period. This will help you become familiar with the studio itself and learn the process of studio rental beyond class hours.
