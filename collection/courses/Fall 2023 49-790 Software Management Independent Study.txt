Course Description: Working with the faculty, realize that the faculty are most interested in Independent Study projects that further their own research goals. You may not be successful on your first inquiry, so please be patient. We want you to have a good Independent Study experience, so faculty are encouraged to say "no" if they don't have the cycles to mentor a project.   Once you and the faculty have agreed upon the independent study, send the independent study form to the director of your program. Students must submit a proposal and be accepted into the course before being able to register.
