Course Description: This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the theory and implementation of algorithms for organizing and searching large text collections. The first half of the course studies text search engines for enterprise and Web environments; the open-source Indri search engine is used as a working example. The second half studies text mining techniques such as clustering, categorization, and information extraction. Programming assignments give hands-on experience with document ranking algorithms, categorizing documents into browsing hierarchies, and related topics.
