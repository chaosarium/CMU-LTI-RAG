Course Description: ne of the earliest forms of proto-chemistry, dyeing textiles has a long history of rich cultural traditions and technical innovations - which we will explore and practice. In this course students will focus on color through working with dyes for textiles scientifically, artistically, and culturally. You will learn the chemical science of color and techniques to isolate natural pigment for dyes as well as how to produce dyes synthetically. Students learn a variety of methods to apply our dyes to textiles to create beautiful patterns: immersion dyeing, resist and folding techniques, and printing. You will be exposed to the use of laboratory equipment and will be trained in good laboratory practices and safety. In preparation for your final project, throughout the course, we will discuss the cultural significance of colors, the origin of pigments, their production impact on the economy of the area, sustainability, and environmental impact of the waste produced by the textile dyeing industry.
