Course Description: Science Fiction Cinema offers an idiosyncratic survey of the science fiction film genre. More than just a form of entertainment, science fiction is a powerful tool for exploring our hopes, fears, and dreams about the future. This class reveals how science fiction films often grapple with philosophical and ethical questions about the nature of humanity and our place in the universe.  Together we will explore how filmmakers have used the science fiction film genre to explore both the timeless human condition and the complex issues of their time.   In addition to studying the films themselves, we will consider the various cultural, social, political, and technological contexts in which they were created as well as how the films have themselves influenced society and culture. Additionally, we will examine the creative and technical innovations that filmmakers use to create stunning and thought-provoking works of art.   Throughout the course, we will watch and analyze a variety of science fiction films, from international and independent productions like "World on a Wire", "Stalker" and "Advantageous" to blockbuster and studio productions like "Nope", "The Wandering Earth" and "The Matrix".   Through weekly readings, film screenings, and class discussions, students will learn to analyze film as a creative medium of social commentary and critique. Assignments will include personal written responses to the films and readings, visual essays, and creative projects.
