Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: The goal of this semester's work is to revise and improve the paper you completed in 79-701 on the basis of summer research and work during the semester.  The finished product should be either a revised journal-length article or a longer piece that might eventually serve as the foundation of one or more chapters of a dissertation. Students should plan to make the choice of which product they will work on in consultation with the course instructor and the advisor.  Learning Objectives  By the end of the semester, students should have:  * improved their skills of revising their writing in response to critical evaluations;  * developed further the ability to critique constructively their  own work and the work of others;  * deepened their analysis of primary and secondary sources relevant to their research topics by completing an annotated bibliography;  * learned basic  features of successful grant-writing and become acquainted with likely sources of external funding to support your  future research;  * written  a polished, journal-length paper based on original research and secondary reading -- one that is  appropriate for submission to a journal of their choosing, OR  a longer text that could serve as the foundation of one or more dissertation chapters.
