Course Description: Organic chemistry is an intimate part of the drug discovery and design processes in areas that include structure determination (NMR, mass spectrometry), synthesis, and determination of mechanisms of action. Once a promising compound (i.e. a ?lead?) has been identified in the laboratory, it is rarely ready to be used in the clinic. Complications include poor bioavailability, rapid degradation, and off-target effects. Students will learn about lead compound optimization through structural variations, cell-specific targeting and pro-drug strategies. Several examples will be presented to illustrate the role played by organic chemistry in the development of drugs used to treat a range of diseases, including cancer, HIV-AIDS, bacterial infections and heart disease.
