Course Description: Students who enroll in Introductory Psychology Courses (100 level or 200 level) are required to complete a research requirement.  The Research Requirement Administrator attends each of these classes to describe the research requirement.  Students may fulfill this research requirement in one of two ways:  (1) participate in three experiments or (2) read a research article and answer a set of questions about it.  If students elect to participate in the experiments, they must complete a pretest questionnaire prior to their participation.
