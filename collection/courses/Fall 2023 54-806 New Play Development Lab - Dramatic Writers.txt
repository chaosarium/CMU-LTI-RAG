Course Description: An opportunity for the second year graduate playwrights.  This course will serve as an intensive workshop for new plays in collaboration for playwrights and dramaturgs. Playwrights will present pages from a piece they are currently developing, utilizing other playwrights and dramaturgs as their "cast" for the purpose of hearing the play aloud. The dramaturg paired with each playwright will facilitate a feedback session, built from conversation with the playwright, to elicit feedback from those in class that will aid in the creation of future drafts.
