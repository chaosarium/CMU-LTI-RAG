Course Description: Arabic for Global Exchange is a course in Arabic language and culture that utilizes cognitive learning technologies and computer-assisted language instruction to enhance educational, governmental, and business exchanges that are increasingly vital to public policy and economic development in the global economy. This is a mini-course for individuals with no proficiency or extremely limited knowledge of Arabic language and culture who are about to begin study or work in an Arabic-speaking context.   The course introduces learners to basic concepts and information to facilitate entry and engagement in an Arabic-speaking environment. The Arabic for Global Exchange project aims to meet a need for high quality, communication-oriented instructional materials to introduce basic cultural knowledge and survival language. Arabic for Global Exchange is a six-week, six-lesson, half-semester course (equivalent of six weeks of university-level instruction), or roughly sixty hours of student effort. Each of the six lessons in the course includes texts and activities to promote acquisition of cultural content in English as well as basic introductory exposure to the Arabic language.   **Contact the instructor directly for meeting day/time information**
