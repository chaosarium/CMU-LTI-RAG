Course Description: In June 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union.  The Brexit vote reflected broader trends in British politics and still casts a major shadow over the country. Exploring the history of contemporary Britain from the 1970s to today, this mini-course explores themes related to national and racial identities, nostalgia for empire, deindustrialization and right-wing populism, to excavate the roots of the Brexit controversy.  The class will also introduce students to the current divisions and dominant parties in British and Northern Irish parliamentary politics.
