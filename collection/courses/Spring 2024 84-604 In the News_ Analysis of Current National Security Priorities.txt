Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: This discussion-based course will examine the headlines in international relations and politics, defense, national security and homeland security. We will follow major news stories, breaking down media coverage to go deeper, conducting our own unique analysis as a group but also individually, contextualizing issues within the broader global context. Students will have the opportunity to lead discussions on breaking news stories, but also to draw upon prior past headlines which still dominate the news cycle or have wider implications for international relations. The goal of this course is to encourage students to think deliberately and deeply about current events, and to contextualize those events in the broader international relations and security context.
