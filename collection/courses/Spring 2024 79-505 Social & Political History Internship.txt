Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: The Social & Political History program strongly encourages students to locate internship opportunities in Pittsburgh or elsewhere that complement their historical interests (as, for example, in a museum or historical society) or areas of policy research that link closely with their historical interests (as, for example, in a government agency or non-profit organization). To earn academic credit for their internship, students will be required to maintain a weekly journal; write a short critical reflection on how the internship connects to their academic interests; and share their experience with other Social & Political History majors. The Academic Advisor will assist students with matching their interests to local organizations. SPH students can earn up to 9 units in each internship. However, the internship credits they earn will not count toward fulfillment of the course requirements (93 units) for the SPH major.
