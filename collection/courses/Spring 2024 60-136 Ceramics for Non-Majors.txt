Course Description: This course is intended for those studying ceramics for the first time, and is a comprehensive introduction to the craft of ceramic art. The primary emphasis is on studio work leading to a portfolio of finished pieces by the end of the semester.   The goal of this course is that students will be able to create expressive, three-dimensional clay forms with the proper understanding of the materials and process. The topics include, but are not limited to, clay and glaze compositions and formulations, various hand-building techniques such as soft and hard slab, pinch, coil, and wheel-throwing. Also, surface treatment techniques such as texturing and underglaze painting will be introduced. You will learn about other cultures and periods of human expression through clay. Discussions will include contemporary artists working in ceramics as well as historical examples and various approaches and techniques for working in clay.  For the final project of the semester students will have an opportunity to develop and complete a project of their own with the instructor's guidance. No prior experience in clay is required.
