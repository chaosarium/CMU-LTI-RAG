Course Description: Any autonomous agent we develop must perceive and act in a 3D world. The ability to infer, model, and utilize 3D representations is therefore of central importance in AI, with applications ranging from robotic manipulation and self-driving to virtual reality and image manipulation. While 3D understanding has been a longstanding goal in computer vision, it has witnessed several impressive advances due to the rapid recent progress in (deep) learning techniques e.g. differentiable rendering, single-view 3D prediction. The goal of this course is to explore this confluence of 3D Vision and Learning-based Methods.
