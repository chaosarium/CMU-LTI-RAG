Graduate students with insufficient scores on the Theory Competency Exam, as well as those who wish to solidify their theoretical skills before taking the more advanced theory courses, are advised to enroll in this class.  A grade of at least a B in this course is needed to fulfill the requirements of the Theory Competency Exam.
