Course Description: In this course students build on the skills of Foundations I to develop acumen in targeted research in support of production. The students learn the "circles of knowledge" technique to provide evidentiary arguments concerning a play script, its author, the historical contexts in which it was written, the theoretical frameworks that may be applied to its interpretations, its production history, and what knowledge is needed to bring its themes to relevance in a modern production. As in Foundations I, there is a great deal of exposure to significant texts, both artistic and philosophical, from theatre history.    Registration for this course is limited to Drama majors.  All other majors must request the instructor's permission.
