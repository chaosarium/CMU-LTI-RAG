Course Description: This course will provide an overview of emerging wearable health technologies and give students hands-on experience in solving ongoing technical challenges. The wearable sensing field is experiencing explosive growth, with exciting applications in medicine. New lightweight devices will make it easier to monitor health conditions in real time, automatically import data into health informatics systems, and provide haptic feedback with humans in the loop. We will review several aspects of these technologies, including hardware, software, user experience, communication networks, applications, and big data analytics. Students will be paired with a company for a semester-long project that tackles timely computational challenges. Programing experience, in any language, is a pre-requisite.
