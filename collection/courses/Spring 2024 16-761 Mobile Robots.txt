Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: The course is targeted to graduate level students. The lectures will develop the fundamentals for enabling autonomy of multi rotor aerial vehicles. Students will individually complete assignments related to autonomous quadrotor flight, including motion planning, control, dynamics, state estimation, and perception. The class will culminate in a final project in which students may work together in groups or individually to enhance the autonomy capabilities developed through the assignments.
