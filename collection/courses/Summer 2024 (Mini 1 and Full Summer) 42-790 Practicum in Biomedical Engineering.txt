Course Description: Students will work with a faculty member, local biomedically-oriented company or local clinical researcher on a technical research, development or outreach project.  A faculty member affiliated with the Department of Biomedical Engineering will either serve as the advisor for an internal project or as a liaison for an external industrial/clinical project.  The project will culminate in an oral presentation and an internally-archived written report which documents the project and its results.  The presentation and report will be reviewed by the faculty advisor/liaison; this review will serve as the basis for the assignment of the course grade. Pre-requisite:  Graduate standing and consent of faculty advisor/liaison.  Variable units.
