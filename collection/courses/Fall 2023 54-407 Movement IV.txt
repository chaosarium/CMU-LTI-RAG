Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: Movement IV is a Lecoq-based course that focuses upon the creation of actor generated physical theatre. In contrast to the actor-as-interpreter tradition, class work is completely centered upon the actor-as-creator. All performance material is created by the students themselves. Class work includes solo, duo, and ensemble explorations. Improvisational prompts and various themes will be introduced and explored, resulting in improvised or semi-rehearsed presentations. Potential themes include autobiographical material, topical issues, original music theatre, inspirations from nature, interpretations of art (music/poetry/paintings), mask performance, contrasting characters, clown entrees, etc. A final project or projects will be determined by the class material generated throughout the semester, as well as by student interest. Limited to Acting/MT majors only.       Prerequisite Knowledge: Movement I, II, and III
