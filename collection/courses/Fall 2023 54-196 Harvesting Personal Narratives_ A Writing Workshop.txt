Course Description: In this welcoming writing workshop, we will work to discover, shape, refine, and share stories sparked from personal experience. Students can expect in-class writing exercises, tools for finding story-worthy moments, and an investigation of varied works inspired by lived experiences, as we explore how to take a personal narrative and translate it into a shareable story ready for a reader and/or viewing audience. The course will consider predominantly contemporary works from a variety of mediums including plays, screenplays, short films, television pilots, and web series. Working towards a final in-class reading of student work, students will leave this course with a new, creative writing piece generated from a dynamic combination of self exploration and in-depth revision. Students from all writing backgrounds and experience levels are welcome. Everyone has a story to tell. Come harvest yours this fall.
