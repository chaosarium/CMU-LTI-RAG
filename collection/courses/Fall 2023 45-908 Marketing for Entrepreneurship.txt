<start course description for 45-908 Marketing for Entrepreneurship>
Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: The purpose of this course is to apply basic marketing principles to start-up and early-stage businesses.  The differences between marketing for start-up and early-stage entrepreneurial firms and traditional large businesses are:  1) no or limited marketing budgets to fund activities such as consumer and marketing research and advertising/marketing communications; and 2) lack of readily available historical data to analyze in order to determine marketing tactics and strategies.  The constrained start-up and early-stage firm must learn how to design marketing approaches that will allow it to market within a highly constrained financial environment.
