Course Description: This course provides a rigorous and proof-based treatment of functions of several real variables. The course presumes some mathematical sophistication including the ability to recognize, read, and write proofs. Topics include: Metric spaces. Differential calculus in Euclidean spaces: continuity, differentiability, partial derivatives, gradients, differentiation rules, implicit and inverse function theorems. Multiple integrals. Integration on curves and hypersurfaces: arclength, and generalized area. The divergence theorem and the 3D Stokes theorem. Regarding prerequisites, 21-268 or 21-269 are strongly recommended rather than 21-259. (Three 50 minute lectures)
