<start course description for 03-206 Biomedical Engineering Laboratory>
Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: This laboratory course is designed to provide students with the ability to make measurements on and interpret data from living systems. The experimental modules reinforce concepts from 42-101 Introduction to Biomedical Engineering and expose students to four areas of biomedical engineering: biomedical signal and image processing, biomaterials, biomechanics, and cellular and molecular biotechnology. Several cross-cutting modules are included as well. The course includes weekly lectures to complement the experimental component. Priority for enrollment will be given to students who have declared the Additional Major in Biomedical Engineering. Notes: This course number is reserved for students who are CIT majors and registered with the HPP program. If you require a biology lab for pre-health admissions requirements, register for 42-203 and Dr. Sang Chalacheva will work with students once the semester begins to register for 03-206 instead of 42-203.  Priority for enrollment will be given to students who have declared the Additional Major in Biomedical Engineering.
