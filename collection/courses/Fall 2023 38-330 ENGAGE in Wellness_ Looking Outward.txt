Course Description: ENGAGE in Wellness: Looking Outward is a 1-unit mini-course that MCS students will enroll in the fall of the junior year, designed to give students a holistic understanding of their own personal wellness. The course is structured around the concept of a Wellness Wheel, a model for personal wellness that is used to describe the various areas that students should reflect upon when describing, and ultimately improving, their overall wellness. The MCS Wellness Wheel has nine components: intellectual, physical, emotional, spiritual, environmental, institutional or community, financial, social, and occupational health. During this second course, taken in the first mini of the junior year, students will select one of three areas on which to focus: spiritual, environmental and institutional or community health. They will be asked to engage in a recursive, reflective process to assess their own level of wellness, participate in wellness activities on campus or develop short-term goals and longer-term goal in this area, and identify possible resources that promote this aspect of wellness. Students should expect to devote 9-14 hours to the development and articulation of their plan in order to earn a passing grade. These hours are tied to completion of the requested assessments and not to the activities students' elect to pursue in fulfillment of their wellness plan. THIS COURSE IS FOR JUNIORS ONLY.
