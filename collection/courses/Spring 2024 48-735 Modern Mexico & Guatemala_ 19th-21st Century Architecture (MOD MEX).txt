Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: This course focuses on the 20th-century architectural and urban history of Mexico City.  We will study both the high-style design vanguards and the vernacular built environment.  Topics include the 19th-century ruralscapes and cityscapes that sprouted the seeds of the 1910 Mexican Revolution, the role of arts and architecture in a post-revolutionary world, changing ideas about  art and architecture within a globalizing world of international influences, projects oriented toward the elites including upper-class  suburbs by prominent architects, projects directed towards the working classes including informal settlements by unnamed "squatters", and the cascading environmental challenges that have pushed to the forefront of the 21st century.  A recurring theme of the course will be the various and competing architectural expressions of Mexican identity -- Mexicanidad.  Non-majors are welcome.
