Course Description: The internship option offers PhD students the opportunity to supplement their research program. Students may intern with a for-profit or non-profit firm, or a research lab, or a government agency that provides them an opportunity to collect data relevant for their research, or implement their research via field study within the firm, or collaborate with other researchers on a project.      The work must be approved by their faculty advisor as well as by the firm. The faculty advisor should also define deliverables clearly and be willing to provide a pass/fail grade. They will need an approval from their faculty advisor and the PhD program director before registering for the course.
