Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: The purpose of this course is to achieve a broad overview of the application of mechanics to the human body. This includes solid, fluid, and viscoelastic mechanics applied to single cells, the cardiovascular system, lungs, muscles, bones, and human movement. The physiology of each system will be reviewed as background prior to discussing mechanics applications within that system. Prior knowledge/experience in statics, fluid mechanics, and biology are helpful.
