Course Description: This course uses stochastic calculus to develop models for equity and fixed income derivatives.  Change of measure is critical in such models, and the course begins with a detailed discussion of that, including the role and limitations of risk-neutral pricing.  The use of forward measures in fixed income models and the change of measure associated with change of currency will be developed.  There is also a discussion of the effect of funding and collateral on the Black-Scholes pricing formula.
