Course Description: This is an intermediate studio course in experimental drawing, generative art, computational design, and mechatronic mishegoss. Working at the boundaries of creative code, automation, physical materials, and gestural mark-making, we will explore personal and peculiar new approaches to digital imaging; the development of ultra-niche workflows as a mode of creative practice; and the use of algorithms and machine collaborators as nontraditional intermediaries between mind, hand, and paper. Drawings will be created using AxiDraw plotters and a variety of other specialized robots. Interested students should have JavaScript and/or Python programming experience equivalent to an introductory course such as 15-104, '110 or '112.
