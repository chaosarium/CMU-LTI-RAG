Course Description: A first course in linear algebra intended for scientists, engineers, mathematicians and computer scientists.  Students will be required to write some straightforward proofs.  Topics to be covered: complex numbers, real and complex vectors and matrices, rowspace and columnspace of a matrix, rank and nullity, solving linear systems by row reduction of a matrix, inverse matrices and determinants, change of basis, linear transformations, inner product of vectors, orthonormal bases and the Gram-Schmidt process, eigenvectors and eigenvalues, diagonalization of a matrix, symmetric and orthogonal matrices. 21-127 is strongly recommended. (Three 50 minute lectures, one 50 minute recitation)
