Course Description: This course is an in-depth look at the popular programming language Java. It is not intended for first time programmers. After some preliminaries devoted to basic syntax and program structure, classes, composition, inheritance and polymorphism are examined. The Java collection classes are studied in some detail, as is the rather complex set of I/O classes. Additional topics include exception handling, building GUIs with JavaFX, and multi-threading. Throughout the second half of the course, a series of homework problems develops a non-toy application, illustrating by example how larger object-oriented programs are organized.
