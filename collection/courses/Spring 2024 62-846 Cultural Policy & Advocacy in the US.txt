Course Description: The work of arts managers is shaped both positively and negatively by cultural policy at the local state and federal levels. In this course we will examine the following core questions: what is cultural policy; who creates cultural policy in the United States; how have past and present policies shaped our nation's current cultural climate; and what can arts managers do to influence and change cultural policy? Pulling from specific examples within the arts community, we will cover a wide variety of policy issues including censorship, economic impact, public funding, and more. During this course students will be asked to select a current cultural policy issue to research and analyze culminating in the creation of a policy brief and advocacy plan.
