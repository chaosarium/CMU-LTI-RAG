Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: Professionalism is the cornerstone of a healthy and productive workplace. It is a defining component of success, but it is not innate. Rather, professionalism is taught and learned. It should be practiced deliberately and developed over time and with experience. It is a specific skill set that positions individuals for success. This seminar is designed to facilitate students' deliberate thinking about professionalism, so that they can begin to practice it, building their unique brands, ensuring excellence in their internships and thus future careers. Throughout the seminar, we will discuss professional conduct, leadership, and strategies for success. We will discuss real-time workplace challenges, and problem-solve as a group to develop meaningful resolutions. Professionalism is a lifelong skill. The goal of this seminar is to provide students with the necessary tools to begin building their professional careers. Given the right tool set, it will catapult a career forward and open doors indefinitely. This seminar is open only to students participating in the Carnegie Mellon University Washington Semester Program (CMU/WSP) in the semester immediately after taking this course.
