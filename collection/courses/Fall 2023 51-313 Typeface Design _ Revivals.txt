Course Description: Typography is at the core of everything which has to do with communication through text; it contributes to the evolution of society/culture and is an integral part of contemporary design. This is an intensive studio course on a central-most aspect of typography, typeface design, including its history, context, production, and contemporary practice. This elective will answer such questions as; what is a font, how did they technically develop, and how are they made (and used) today? This studio will introduce students to a research-based approach to typeface design and will take advantage of historic materials from the Hunt Library's Special Collections as a place to start our journey into the world of type. This research-based approach on historical models will inform the semester-long development of a font; everyone will end the semester with a Latin-based typeface revival for contemporary use based on their unique materials and research findings.
