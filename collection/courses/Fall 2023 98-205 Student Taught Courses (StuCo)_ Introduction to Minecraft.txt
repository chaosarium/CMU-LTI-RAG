Course Description: Minecraft is the single most sold video game of all time. It places you in a randomly generated world of blocks and sets you free to survive and be creative in a completely sandbox environment. This course will provide an in-depth introduction of how to play Minecraft, including basic to advanced survival skills, multiplayer aspects, modding, and whatnot. Along with playing survival Minecraft together on a class server, we will also play fun Minecraft minigames in class and explore possibilities such as playing on public servers. By the end of this class, students should know the basics about Minecraft and be able to survive in a Minecraft world, as well as expand their knowledge about Minecraft to depth within and out of the game. This class is designed for both players completely new to the game as well as those with plenty of experience looking to play Minecraft with some new friends. The game costs $30 and is required for the course.
