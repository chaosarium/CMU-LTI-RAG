Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: Using classical and jazz guitar methods, this course is designed to provide a basic set of techniques that will allow students to pursue the avenue of guitar playing that most interests them.  While emphasis will be on developing skills in playing the guitar, a basic understanding of the principles of music theory as applied to the guitar will also be acquired.    While few students will find it possible to master all of the materials presented, an exposure to the many possibilities of musical expression available on the guitar and an understanding of basic music theory will help to broaden the students' perspective and make future musical experiences, such as listening and performing, more rewarding.    Each student is expected to have his/her own instrument.  A guitar in good working condition is essential.  An acoustic classical or steel string is preferred, an electric with a small battery operated amp is acceptable.    Students having no previous training on the guitar will find this class most valuable.
