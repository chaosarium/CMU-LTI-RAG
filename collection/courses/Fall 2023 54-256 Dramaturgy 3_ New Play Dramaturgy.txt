Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: This course focuses on the dramaturg's collaborative relationship with a playwright during the creation of a new play. During the first mini, dramaturgs work on close reading of multiple drafts of a new play, tracking changes and assessing their impact, and developing healthy collaborative processes. During the second mini, playwrights join the course; each dramaturg is matched with a playwright and puts those new skills into practice. Required for dramaturgy majors; no non-majors will be admitted to this course in fall 2020.
