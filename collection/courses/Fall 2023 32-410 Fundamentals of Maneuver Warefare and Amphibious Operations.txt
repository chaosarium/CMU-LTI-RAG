Course Description: A historical survey of the development of amphibious doctrine and the conduct of amphibious operations. Emphasis is placed on the evolution of amphibious warfare in the twentieth century, especially during World War II. Focus is applied to four main themes: political/strategic situation, sea-to-land transitions, tactics ashore, and development of amphibious technology. Present day potential and limitations on amphibious operations, including the rapid deployment force concept, are explored.
