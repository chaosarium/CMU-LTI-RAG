Course Description: Working with people can be challenging, whether they are your peers, colleagues, clients, and/or users. But challenging does not mean negative and having a positive attitude toward collaboration is key. In the words of humorist Amy Poehler: ""As you navigate through the rest of your life, be open to collaboration. Other people and other people's ideas are often better than your own. Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you, spend a lot of time with them, and it will change your life." In this micro, let's change some lives as we explore through a myriad of activities what it really means to work with people.  FALL 2023 COURSE MEETING DATES:  September 1, 8 & 15
