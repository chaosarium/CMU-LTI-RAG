Course Description: Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) constitute an essential component of any network security solution package. Underlying IDSs is a great deal of fascinating mathematics taken from fields such as probability theory, statistics, and detection theory. A good understanding of this mathematical background will enable students to better appreciate the benefits and limitations of IDSs and prepare them to become better security practitioners.
