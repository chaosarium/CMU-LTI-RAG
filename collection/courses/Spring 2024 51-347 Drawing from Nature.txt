Course Description: Drawing From Nature  This course is about observing and making images of  things growing, crawling, flying, swimming etc. Observations will be made firsthand in the field, supported with relevant research in topic areas with the aim of deepening personal understanding of all things biological. Issue surrounding natural forms such as behavior, locomotion, adaptation, the environment and systems will also be investigated. We will work in tandem on refining our abilities in communicating what we discover through the process of drawing. A variety of visualization methods will be covered i.e. analytical drawing, visual notes, and diagramming to name a few. We will be using a variety of basic drawing and digital media to develop our work as we uncover aspects of form, structure and surface. Guest speakers will present work they have done in areas such as botany, biology, and environmental studies to name a few.  A majority of the work will be done in the field and will then be developed in the studio. A final project will be assigned that will challenge you to develop a concept along with a compelling form(s) that communicates what you have uncovered about nature to a variety of audiences. This course builds on your experiences from First Year drawing and introduces several more advanced visualization methods.  This course is intended for Junior and Senior Design Majors.
