Course Description: This course provides an introduction to principles of time-independent quantum mechanics, needed to understand various molecular properties and phenomena. The main topics to be covered include: postulates of quantum mechanics, i.e., the Schr√∂dinger equation and the wavefunction description, a particle in a box, tunneling, a particle on a sphere, a rigid rotor, a harmonic oscillator, hydrogen-like atoms, many-electron atoms and diatomic molecules.  The variational principle is also introduced.
