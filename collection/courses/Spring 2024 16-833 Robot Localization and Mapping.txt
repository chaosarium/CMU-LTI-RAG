Course Description: Robot localization and mapping are fundamental capabilities for mobile robots operating in the real world. Even more challenging than these individual problems is their combination: simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Robust and scalable solutions are needed that can handle the uncertainty inherent in sensor measurements, while providing localization and map estimates in real-time. We will explore suitable efficient probabilistic inference algorithms at the intersection of linear algebra and probabilistic graphical models. We will also explore state-of-the-art systems.
