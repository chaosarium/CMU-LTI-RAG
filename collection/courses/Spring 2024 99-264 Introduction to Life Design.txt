Course Description: "What do you want to be when you grow up?" is a dysfunctional question that is asked by society to every child. The nature of this question implies individuals should have a single goal that they desire to reach - and that happiness/success will be achieved when this goal is reached.  Instead, Introduction to Life Design asks individuals to explore what they want to grow into as life unfolds. Students in this course will identify what work and life mean to them, explore how their social identities influence how they engage with the world, ideate future possibilities, and learn how to explore those possibilities by prototyping experiences.  This class is for juniors and seniors who want to learn how to create and navigate a life of meaning. Attendance is required at the Friday sessions because small group sharing is an integral part of the course pedagogy.
