Course Description: Hands-on laboratory projects will teach students about all aspects of metals additive manufacturing (AM). Students will learn how to use SOLIDWORKS for part design, create and transfer design files to the AM machines, run the machines to build parts, perform post-processing operations, and characterize AM parts. Student will work in teams and complete three separate lab projects, each utilizing a different material system, part design, AM process/machine, post-processing steps and characterization methods. A major lab report and presentation will be required for each of the three lab projects. The course includes weekly lectures to complement the laboratory component.
