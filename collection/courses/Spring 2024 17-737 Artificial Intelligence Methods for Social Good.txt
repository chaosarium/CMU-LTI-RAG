Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: The rapid advance in artificial intelligence (AI) has opened up new possibilities of using AI to tackle the most challenging societal problems today. This course brings together a set of advanced AI methods that allow us to address such challenges and promote social good:  Optimization: mathematical programming, robust optimization, influence maximization Game Theory and Mechanism Design: security games, human behavior modeling, auction and market equilibrium, citizen science Machine Learning: classification, clustering, probabilistic graphical models, deep learning Sequential Decision Making: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), partially observable MDPs, online planning, reinforcement learning In addition to providing a deep understanding of these methods, the course will introduce which societal challenges they can tackle and how, in the areas of (i) healthcare, (ii) social welfare, (iii) security and privacy, (iv) environmental sustainability. The course will also cover special topics such as AI and Ethics and AI and Humans.   The course content is designed to not have too much overlap with other AI courses offered at CMU. Although the course is listed within SCS, it should be of interest to students in several other departments, including ECE, EPP and SDS This 12-unit course is only open to graduate students (master and Ph.D. students) with previous programming experience and background knowledge in artificial intelligence. The students will work in groups on a research project with a research-style paper and an oral presentation delivered at the end of the semester. Please see the instructor if you are unsure whether your background is suitable for the course.
