Course Description: During capstone, Interdisciplinary teams of MIIPS students from engineering, business, and design backgrounds use methods and innovative mindsets to research the needs, wants and desires of a market opportunity, define product specifications, conceptualize products to meet the users' needs and desires and refine the most promising concept. The result is a resolved form, functional design, and marketing plan delivered to a sponsor by the end of the semester. The course also focuses on communicating about the work through multiple presentations and reports. This is a required course in the MIIPS degree program.
