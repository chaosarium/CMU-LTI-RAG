Course Description: This laboratory course is devoted to physical chemistry experiments, which involve the use of modern spectroscopic instrumentation to probe the optical and magnetic properties of molecules. The experiments include the use of high-resolution infrared, laser Raman, NMR, EPR, fluorescence, and UV-visible spectroscopies. Additional experiments demonstrate methods for measuring enzyme-catalyzed reaction rate constants, and the use of scanning probe microscopy for imaging and characterization of biological macromolecules.Throughout the course the students will learn how to use computer algebra packages for rigorous data analysis and modeling and will develop the skills in basic electronics, and vacuum techniques. 2 hrs. lec., 6 hrs. lab.
