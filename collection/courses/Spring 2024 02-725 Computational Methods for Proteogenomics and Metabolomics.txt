Course Description: Proteomics and metabolomics are the large scale study of proteins and metabolites, respectively.  In contrast to genomes, proteomes and metabolomes vary with time and the specific stress or conditions an organism is under. Applications of proteomics and metabolomics include determination of protein and metabolite functions (including in immunology and neurobiology) and discovery of biomarkers for disease. These applications require advanced computational methods to analyze experimental measurements, create models from them, and integrate with information from diverse sources.  This course specifically covers computational mass spectrometry, structural proteomics, proteogenomics, metabolomics, genome mining and metagenomics.
