Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: This course will be a hands-on investigation of the material, tangible, and physical aspects of painting.  Students will learn how to make and use various paints, supports and grounds including oil paint, egg tempera, encaustic, watercolor/gouache, distemper, casein and fresco (in addition to other materials based on student interest).  The working properties of various additives to and combinations of these media will be examined and experimented with.  Technical issues affecting longevity will be addressed and experimentation will be encouraged.  Students will investigate the work of other artists with a forensic "How did they do that?" approach.  The second half of the semester will be devoted to studio work focusing on the ways in which each student's personal vision can be embodied and expanded in one or more of the above media.
