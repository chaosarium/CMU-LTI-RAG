Course Description: [Note: students who have already taken this course under its former number 79-255 and former titles, Irish History, or Politics, Religion, and Conflict in the 19th and 20th Century Ireland, may not enroll.]    This course studies the political, economic and social development of Ireland across its long nineteenth century.  Beginning with the social and economic effects of the Famine of the 1840s, it studies Ireland's growing incorporation into the British-centric global economy, the growing role of Catholicism in Irish politics, the cultural ferment of the late nineteenth century and the events leading up to formal independence in 1922.  Following on from this, the course reviews the development of the two Irelands (the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland), the rise to hegemony of Fianna FÃ¡il and the Ulster Unionist Party, the politics of gender and sexuality in two of western Europe's most conservative societies, violence in Northern Ireland, and rapid economic, social and political changes since the 1990s.  Ultimately, this course seeks to use Ireland as a case study for understanding the history of small nations and modern European nationalism as well as economic and political development on the periphery of Europe.
