Course Description: TThis course provides an introduction to the subject of Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM). PGM give a unified view for a wide range of problems arising in several domains such as artificial intelligence, statistics, computer systems, computer vision, natural language processing, and computational biology, among many other fields. They provide a very flexible and powerful framework for capturing statistical dependencies in complex, multivariate data. PGM brings together probability theory and graph theory to enable efficient inference, decision-making, and learning in problems with a very large number of attributes and huge datasets. This introductory course will provide you with a strong foundation necessary for applying graphical models to complex problems.
