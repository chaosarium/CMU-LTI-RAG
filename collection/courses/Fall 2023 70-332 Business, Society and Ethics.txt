This course will explore ethical challenges faced by modern corporations, and frameworks which can be used to develop responsible corporate policy. The course is divided into four main units: (1) autonomy and consent, (2) the scope and locus of corporate responsibility, (3) fair treatment and outcomes, (4) the limits of labor and commodification.
