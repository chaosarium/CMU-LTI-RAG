Course Description: In this course, we will create books that explore visual narrative, sequencing, and sculptural form through the medium of photography. Additionally, we will consider the roles of image and text as well as design, editing, printing and binding. Our work will be informed by the history photobooks and artists' books, including by Ed Ruscha, Sophie Calle, Andres Gonzalez, Tommy Kha and Rinko Kawauchi. Lectures and field trips to book collections will guide our work too.
