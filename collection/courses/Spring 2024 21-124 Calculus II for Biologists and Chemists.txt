Course Description: This is intended as a second calculus course for biology and chemistry majors.  It uses a variety of computational techniques based around the use of MATLAB or a similar system. Topics to be covered include: Integration: techniques and numerical integration. Ordinary differential equations: techniques for solving ODEs and numerical methods. Modeling with ODEs (e.g., infection, population models). Linear algebra: matrices, complex numbers, eigenvalues, eigenvectors. Systems of ordinary differential equations (if time allows: stability of differential systems). Probability: discrete and continuum probability, conditional probability and independence, limit theorems, important distributions, probabilistic models.  (Three 50 minute lectures, two 50 minute recitations)
