Course Description: This 9-unit course is designed for students who have reached the intermediate level of proficiency in the use of Chinese language to develop their language process competency in all four skills to a more advanced level. Students will expand explicit knowledge of socio-cultural influences on Chinese language use, and be able to apply the knowledge to conduct culturally appropriate spoken and written communication across various social domains and genres. Topics to be covered in this class will be closely related to current social issues in China, such as population, youth, love & marriage and housing. Students will also develop a repertoire of strategies and resources to assist their learning so that they will be gradually becoming autonomous learners who are able to conduct independent learning of the Chinese language, culture, history, and society.
