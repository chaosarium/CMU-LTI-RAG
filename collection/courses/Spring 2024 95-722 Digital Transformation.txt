Course Description: This course serves as a capstone course integrating technological and managerial aspects of information technology. We will take the culmination of your previous learning of technological and managerial subjects and apply it to real-world scenarios. Each section will consider the information and communication technologies that play multiple roles within an organizational context through two perspectives:  -    From a technological perspective, these define the information and communication infrastructures of the firm and they enable new ways to digitize business processes.  -    From a managerial perspective, these facilitate new coordination and communication within and across entities, enable new organizational forms, change the information environment underlying the business, and permit new incentive structures.
