Course Description: Since ancient times, mathematical arguments have served as a paradigm for rational inquiry. We will study fundamental mathematical concepts and informal proofs as they occur in everyday mathematics. We will also use the methods of mathematical logic, which provides formal symbolic languages, to help us understand the structure of a mathematical argument. Finally, we will make use of a new computational "proof assistant," called Lean, to develop fully rigorous, machine-checked proofs.
