Course Description: This is a two-semester course in Acting for Third-Year Actors & MTs who will explore performance within directed structure in various non-Fourth-Wall forms of Theatre including:  Greek Tragedy.  This is not a course that will aspire to provide any "correct" way to play various "styles".  Rather, it is a course in which to acquire new tools & perspectives when working in new theatrical worlds.  Goals include:  to find the appropriate level of external expression to meet the demands of the particular text & its directed world, & to "fill the Form" believably & passionately; to make active choices within a directed framework; to learn to work within industry standards; to learn the nature of the actor's "homework" in a directed framework; to include the Audience in the work.
