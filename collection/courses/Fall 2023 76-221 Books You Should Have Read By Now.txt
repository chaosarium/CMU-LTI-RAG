Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: Topics vary by semester and section. Fall 2023: Medical Triumphs and Transgressions - How can literary stories enable us to understand the social possibilities and problems involved in medical advancement, research, and practice? What does good medical care look likedoes it focus on bodily wellbeing alone, or does it also account for psychological and socioeconomic dimensions of wellbeing? How do our social views shape and infiltrate medical discourse, and vice versa? In this class, we will read and discuss novels and occasional creative nonfiction works about a variety of topics: reproductive health and rights, psychiatric care, racial and gender discrimination in healthcare, advances in medical technology (including cloning and the use of human body parts in medical research), and more. We will examine how literature represents medicine's social impacts, revealing both hopes and anxieties about our contemporary world and its future. We will consider: What does the literature say about medicine's values, problems, and goals? What is at stake in medical advancement? Who gets to access medical care, and who experiences barriers?
