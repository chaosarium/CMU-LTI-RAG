Course Description: Defining what musical theater "is" is no easy task. The genre/form/phenomenon as we know it today represents an evolution of embodied practices and interdisciplinary creativity spanning cultures, geographies, traditions, media, and time. Similarly, the history of musical theateror, more appropriately, the histories of musical theatershould not be reduced to simple narratives or linear chronologies. Following this idea, this course offers a topical exploration of musicals on stage and screen, focusing on historical developments, production practices, and artistic agency from the mid-nineteenth century to the present. We will not offer a conventional "survey" of musicals starting from an arbitrary point "way back when" and ending with the state of things in 2022. Like the "concept musicals" of the mid-twentieth century, a non-linear structure allows us to consider broader connections across our subject(s). In addition to repertoire case studies, we will explore the historiography of musical theater; the process of developing musicals from page to stage; the function and labor of performers, administrators, stage directors, stage designers, and technical personnel in making musicals happen; musicals in various media; musicals in the time of the coronavirus pandemic; and concerns of social justice in reviving established works and producing new works. Assignments will include short analysis presentations and written responses. There is no performance component with this course.
