Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: In this class, advanced ceramic students will investigate clay as an art material for personal expression. Students will build on their technical skills using materials and processes appropriate to their concepts while developing aesthetic sensibilities using historic and contemporary references in ceramics and other arts. Each student has the option to direct their own projects with guidance by the instructor upon demonstrating a complete understanding of the various construction skills and surface treatment techniques used in the medium.   Students are expected to learn how to organize their projects and practice time management to generate and complete projects within the given time. Course work supports the development of a body of work to be used as a professional portfolio.   Students are required to participate in critiques that analyze their own work and that of other artists and class participants to identify strengths and weaknesses in research and promote the growth and exchange of ideas. This class will consist of demonstrations and lectures as appropriate, research/writing assignments in and out of class, as well as work time. Students are required to develop a body of work within the context of the projects to express their individual voice.
