Course Description: The Institute for Politics and Strategy (IPS) Policy Forum is one key way in which IPS brings international relations and politics into the intellectual conversation at CMU.  The IPS Policy Forum regularly brings diplomats, scholars, policymakers, journalists, and other thought leaders to the university to address major issues facing the United States and the world.  IPS graduate students will enroll in the three-unit Policy Seminar each semester and be expected to participate in and reflect on their interactions throughout the IPS Policy Forum lectures and roundtable discussions.
