Course Description: What is the shape of the story you are telling? Does it want to be a novel? A punk jazz ritual? A prayerbook? Is it taking the form of a deck of cards, a cookbook, a cassette found in a junked car? Does it speed or slow time? Is it catchy or difficult? If writing is to be useful as a tool for destruction and rebirth, must it find new forms? This writing workshop centers slow reading and beginner's mind. Sources may include Kathy Acker, Inger Christensen, Nathalie LÃ©ger, Horacio Castellanos Moya, M. NourbeSe Philip, Virginia Woolf, and Sarah Vap.
