Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: This first course on the modeling and analysis of dynamic systems concentrates on the motion of particles, systems of particles, and rigid bodies under the action of forces and moments. Topics include the kinematics of motion in rectangular, polar, and intrinsic coordinates; relative motion analysis with multiple reference frames; and planar kinetics through the second law, work-energy method, and impulse-momentum method. Time and frequency domain solutions to first and second order equations of motion are discussed.  3 hrs. lec. 1 hr rec.
