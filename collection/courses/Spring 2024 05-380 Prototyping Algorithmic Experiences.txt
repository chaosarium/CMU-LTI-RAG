Course Description: This project-based course provides an overview and hands-on introduction to iterative prototyping methods in HCI, with an emphasis on current and emerging technologies such as data-driven algorithmic systems, AI and machine learning, spatial computing, and IoT. Students will learn and implement approaches for creating and using prototypes to iteratively inform the creation of new technologies. The course will help students learn to strategically evaluate whether a given prototyping approach is a good fit for a given design or research question. In addition to HCI undergraduate majors, the course is open to undergraduate and graduate level students with proficiency in programming and prior courses or experience in user-centered research, design, and/or evaluation. Some exceptions to the course prerequisites will be granted with permission of the instructor.
