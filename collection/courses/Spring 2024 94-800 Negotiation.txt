Course Description: Welcome to Negotiation. You knew it all along: Life isn't fair. Perhaps what you didn't know, though, is that you can learn to do something about it. Negotiation is not only a talent you can be born with, it's also a skill that can be learned! This course focuses on improving fundamental negotiating competencies in personal and organizational contexts. Negotiation is both an art and a science. This course will teach you how to negotiate more effectively through a combination of assessments, exercises and simulations. In subject matter and approach this class is designed to provide understanding and insight into your present negotiating abilities, as well as challenge your comfort zone to allow for continuous improvement going forward. Negotiation is fast-paced, interactive and hands-on. Drawing upon current research and recognized best practices, we will emphasize both basic mastery and practical application of the subject matter covered. In that respect, and perhaps unlike your other classes at the Heinz College, this course will have elements of both education (learning about) and training (learning how to).  Students cannot take this course as pass/no pass.
