Course Description: You are never more visible in a financial organization than when you present. Clients and top management make conscious and unconscious decisions about your capabilities based upon your ability to communicate your ideas persuasively and succinctly. This course provides intensive training and practice in planning, preparing, and delivering the financial arguments your audiences will demand. Assignments focus on nonverbal, vocal and verbal training; rhetorical strategies that drive problem-solving deliverables; and visualization and framing strategies for financial data-rich content.
