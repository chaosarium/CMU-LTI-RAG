Course Description: This advanced studio class allows for the interdisciplinary exploration of historical, critical, craftbased, and conceptual issues surrounding the Small. The course will look at global and historical examples of small objects and the impulse for humans to make miniatures. It will consider site specific installations and interventions that are often not easily viewable. It is very easy for a large object, an expensive object, to make a big visual and/or social impact.  What does it mean to work on a humble scale and with ephemeral and/or accessible materials? How does working small allow for generosity, play and adaptability?   This is an interdisciplinary advanced studio course. Students will predominantly work in their own studios and bring their own practice/techniques and research to our conversation.
