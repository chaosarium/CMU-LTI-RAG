Course Description: Topology is a less rigid variant of geometry that studies shapes of spaces. Algebraic topology associates algebraic invariants, such as groups or rings, to such spaces. This is achieved by building a space from simpler ones or by algebraically keeping track of how to map a simple space into a given space. This course will cover the fundamental group and covering spaces, homology theories, and the cohomology ring of a space (time permitting).  (Three 50 minute lectures)
