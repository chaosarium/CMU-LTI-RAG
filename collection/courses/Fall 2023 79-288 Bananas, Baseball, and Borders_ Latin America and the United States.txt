Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: This course will examine the tumultuous and paradoxical relationship between Latin America and the United States from the time of independence to the present, with an emphasis on Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean during the Cold War (1945-1989) and its aftermath (1990s-present). We will literally talk about bananas, baseball and borders; the title also alludes to the key dimensions of the relationship we will study: economic, cultural, and geopolitical.  We will learn about the actions of U.S. and Latin American government leaders and diplomats along with many other kinds of people including activists, artists, and journalists; athletes, movie stars, and scientists; and migrant workers, tourists, and drug traffickers. Mondays and Wednesdays will feature interactive lectures, videos and in-class activities; Fridays will be entirely devoted to student-driven discussion. Evaluation will be based on participation; two written analysis of historical documents, and a final reflection.
