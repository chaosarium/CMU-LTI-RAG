Course Description: Building intelligent machines that are capable of extracting meaningful representations from data lies at the core of solving many AI related tasks. In the past decade, researchers across many communities, from applied statistics to engineering, computer science and neuroscience, have developed deep models that are composed of several layers of nonlinear processing. An important property of these models is that they can learn useful representations by re-using and combining intermediate concepts, allowing these models to be successfully applied in a wide variety of domains, including visual object recognition, information retrieval, natural language processing, and speech perception.   The goal of this course is to introduce students to both the foundational ideas and the recent advances in deep learning. The first part of the course will focus on supervised learning, including neural networks, back-propagation algorithm, convolutional models, recurrent neural networks, and  their extensions with applications to image recognition, video analysis, and language modelling. The second part of the course will cover unsupervised learning, including variational autoencoders, sparse-coding, Boltzmann machines, and generative adversarial networks. This course will assume a reasonable degree of mathematical maturity and will require strong programming skills.
