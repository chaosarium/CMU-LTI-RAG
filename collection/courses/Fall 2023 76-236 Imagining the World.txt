Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: We read newspapers for reports about what is happening in our world. But we also read fiction--novels and stories--that tell us about imaginary worlds. Sometimes they are very much like our world, sometimes different. In this course we'll read classic novels like Charles Dickens' Great Expectations or Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment up to contemporary ones like Station Eleven or Severance. We will consider how they represent the world, their use of literary forms, and how they lead us into their alterior world. We will also consider what they say about their culture and society. Do they make a statement about the world, or are they more for entertainment?   This course is based on the Inside-Out Prison Exchange Program, and will be taught at SCI Somerset, a nearby prison.  The course will include both "outside" students from CMU, as well as "inside" students at SCI Somerset. The course focuses on active participation and discussion between students. It runs from 2:30-5:10 on Friday afternoon. CMU students will travel together by bus, leaving our campus at 12:30 and returning by 6:30. To enroll, students in the course will submit a brief application and interview with faculty. The course is part of an exciting new initiative by CMU to bring education into America's prisons.
