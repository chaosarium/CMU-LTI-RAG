Course Description: In many western traditions, the triad is a foundational element for musical construction. Though the ingredient is consistent across many styles, how it is used changes according to time, place, and even for the individual piece. This course is a deep dive into the ways in which triads are used in a variety of western traditions. We will track common practices and notable manipulations across diatonic music, modal, non- and poly- and pan-tonal repertories, and use different methods of notation, annotation, and engagement to better understand how the triad is used in music. Through listening, annotation, performance, and discussion, students will develop methods to identify triad and triad-expanding material, and to build usable analytical practices that are sensitive to the unique sonic footprints of specific musical styles. They will hone skills to communicate their findings, and transfer their interpretation into performance and creative practice. Students will be assessed through regular listening, analytical, and creative assignments, as well as in-class discussion and a final project or paper.
