Course Description: This course will enable students to understand how software coding defects lead to software vulnerabilities, develop secure software, and manage teams that develop secure software. This course provides a detailed explanation of common programming errors in C and C++ and describes how these errors can lead to code that is vulnerable to exploitation. The course covers secure software development tools and processes while focusing on low-level technical security issues intrinsic to the C and C++ programming languages and associated libraries.   The course relies on "learning-by-doing", where students practice hands-on sophisticated secure coding concepts through continuous debugging and creative approaches. Many aspects of the assignments mimic the challenges developers face in a real-world software system. Some assignments will introduce students to a programming language that they might have never seen before such as JavaScript and Rust.
