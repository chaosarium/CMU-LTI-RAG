Course Description: Design Futures frames design in a temporally-extended, systemic context. It offers essential perspectives, practices, and competencies that are increasingly called for as designers progress in their work and careers, and as the design field evolves to acknowledge its significant powers and responsibilities. You will explore numerous futures methods, which support designers through ideation and storytelling, problem-finding and framing, brief formulation, project coordination, and collaboration. Coursework includes engagement with readings and videos, hands-on creative workshops, and visual prototyping and sketching. Design Futures knowledge and methods are foundational to Transition Design.
