Course Description: Students are taught the language of filmmaking and the director's craft as it applies to the digital format. Aspects of mise-en-scene, visual storytelling, continuity-style coverage, temporal and spatial montage theory, directing actors and thinking visually, will be essential to the new media director's palette. All forms of digital filmmaking will be discussed including dramatic, documentary and independent features as well as commercials, music videos and experimental subjects. Through lectures, readings, screenings, web-postings, discussions, writing and production assignments, you will learn the basic principles and vocabulary of film theory and aesthetics. Understanding these fundamental ideas will help you develop a more critical eye towards creating new media.
