Course Description: A technical introduction to the fundamentals of programming with an emphasis  on producing clear, robust, and reasonably efficient code using top-down  design, informal analysis, and effective testing and debugging. Starting  from first principles, we will cover a large subset of the Python  programming language, including its standard libraries and programming  paradigms.  We will also target numerous deployment scenarios, including  standalone programs, shell scripts, and web-based applications.  This course assumes no prior programming experience. Even so, it is a  fast-paced and rigorous preparation for 15-122.  Students seeking a more  gentle introduction to computer science should consider first taking 15-110.    NOTE: students must achieve a C or better in order to use   this course to satisfy the pre-requisite for any subsequent Computer   Science course. (GHC Clusters are the 3 labs on on Gates floor 5, 5207, 5208, and 5210)
