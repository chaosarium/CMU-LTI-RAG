Course Description: Witness the remarkable adaptability of your own brain while developing a skill set that leads to success in a broad range of academic domains including science, mathematics, and logical reasoning. Spatial visualization training is known to elevate students' performance and grades in a wide range of college classes. Yet, traditional schools do not teach spatial visualization, leaving many college students without this critical skill. In this course we will hone our mental capacities for spatial visualization using a robust training technique that has proven successful for enhancing academic performance in thousands of college students. The course involves an introduction to brain plasticity and adaptability, a tour of the CMU brain imaging center, mental exercises in spatial reasoning that you complete one day per week on a phone or tablet, and an examination of data illustrating the transformative effects of spatial training on your brain. We will study how well spatial visualization training works on our own minds and brains. Experience firsthand how spatial visualization, a skill often overlooked in traditional education, can enhance your academic and professional future - and observe how it changes your brain.
