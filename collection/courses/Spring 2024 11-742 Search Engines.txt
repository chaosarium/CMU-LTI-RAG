The core components include statistical characteristics of text, representation of information needs and documents, several important retrieval models, and experimental evaluation. The course also covers common elements of commercial search engines, for example, integration of diverse search engines into a single search service (federated search, vertical search), personalized search results, and diverse search results. The software architecture components include design and implementation of large-scale, distributed search engines.   This is a full-semester course.
