Course Description: This course provides a place for students to practice the necessary computational background for further study in machine learning. Topics covered include computational complexity, analysis of algorithms, proof techniques, optimization, dynamic programming, recursion, and data structures. The course assumes some background in each of the above, but will review and give practice in each. (It does not provide from-scratch coverage of all of the above, which would be impossible in a course of this length.) Some coding will be required: the course will provide practice with translating the above computational concepts into concrete programs.  This course is one of two minis intended to prepare students for further study in machine learning -- particularly for taking 10-601 and 10-701. One of the courses 10-606 focuses on mathematical background, and the other course 10-607 focuses on computational background. Most students take both mini courses, but this is not required. 10-606 is not a prerequisite of 10-607.
