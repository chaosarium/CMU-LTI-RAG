Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: The focus of this seminar is the connection between policy, planning, and the design of regions, cities, neighborhoods, including to the scale of the individual project or building. International, federal, state, and local policy and planning all impact urban design and communities. Built form and urban landscapes, from new housing and university campuses to reused factories and brownfield developments, respond to overarching urban models and plans as well as to detailed incentives, regulations and review processes driven by social, economic, and environmental aims. This course addresses these relationships first by studying the overarching frameworks, from local zoning to global sustainable development goals. Through the lens of contemporary planning and urban design practice and research, it analyzes the fundamental premises of planning from housing to transportation, while also studying emerging models and practices responding to the imperatives of climate change, socioeconomic equity, community empowerment, and ubiquitous information. The seminar draws on research, teaching, and practice relevant to international, North American, and Pittsburgh perspectives. The course is organized by four modules: 1) Challenge and Frameworks; 2) Existing and Future Strategies; Innovation and its Alternatives; and 4) Project Proposals.
