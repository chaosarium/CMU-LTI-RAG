Course Description: In this course we will consider the differences between traditional live storytelling and stories that are captured to be viewed remotely or at a later date.  Using the lens as the proscenium, you control how your audience experiences the story.  How do you prepare for that?  How does the lens change the way we design?  We will  talk with and explore the work of  industry professionals such as directors, cinematographers, production designers, editors, and costume designers.  Hands on, we will storyboard and shoot our own stories.
