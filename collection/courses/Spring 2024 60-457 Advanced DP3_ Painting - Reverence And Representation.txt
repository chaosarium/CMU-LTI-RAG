Course Description: Painting's role in deciding prominence has historically been coated in biased power positioning that promotes only a select few. This advanced course will challenge students to scrutinize what they represent and revere through indelible materials. Throughout the semester, they will work through a proposed series of carefully conceived paintings that consider their own idealized notions of value. The question of "who or what deserves to be labored over, visible, and elevated" will be dissected through research, group critiques, and one one-on-one conversations. Experimentation with various materials will be encouraged with the goal of finding the media that exemplifies their intended meaning. Multiple perspectives and open minds will be applauded.
