Course Description: This course is about fundamental analysis using financial statements. We develop and apply technologies for understanding and identifying firm activities that generate shareholder value and for developing valuation benchmarks. The ultimate goal of such analysis is to aid the security valuation and risk analysis exercises. This course is intended to help students establish a good foundation and introduce students the basics of equity and debt analysis techniques. Taking Finance (70-391) before this course is recommended, though not a formal prerequisite. This course may use third-party course material that is not available for individual purchase from the publisher.
