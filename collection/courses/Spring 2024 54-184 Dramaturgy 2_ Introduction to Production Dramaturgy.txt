Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: Dramaturgy 2 introduces students to the essential tasks and processes that dramaturgs perform on productions of established plays (i.e., plays whose texts are not changing). Students perform text analysis, conduct research, curate and present information, develop and provide critical feedback on production work in progress, and design pre- and post-performance experiences for an audience. This is a writing-intensive course with a high reading load. Dramaturgy 2 is a prerequisite for higher-level courses in the Dramaturgy curriculum.
