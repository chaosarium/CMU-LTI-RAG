Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: This course explores the threshold between the seen and unseen using a broad range of painting styles, techniques, and materials to explore the unconscious mind. Drawing upon a range of spiritual and occult practices, including tarot, automatism, and color meditations, this class offers students the opportunity to explore processes that unlock the imaginative potential of the unconscious and adapt them to painting. Through a series of readings, presentations, field trips, and critiques, the class will gain knowledge of the practices and histories behind the unconscious in art and learn how to harness 'chance' more intentionally into their painting practice. This is a studio-based course in which there will be both project assignments and in-class projects in which students utilize the techniques learned in this class. We will discuss artists like Hilma af Klint, Remedios Varo, Xul Solar, Ghulam Rasool Santosh, and Betye Saar as well as artistic movements including Symbolism, Surrealism, Transcendental Painting Group, and Neo Tantra Painting.
