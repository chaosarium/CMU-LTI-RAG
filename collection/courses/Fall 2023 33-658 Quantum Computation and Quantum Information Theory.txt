Course Description: This course provides an overview of recent developments in quantum computation and quantum information theory. The topics include: a review of relevant concepts in quantum mechanics and in information theory. It will then cover quantum channels, both ideal and noisy, quantum cryptography, an introduction to computational complexity, Shors factorization algorithm, Grovers search algorithm, and proposals for the physical realization of quantum devices, such as correlated photons, ions in traps, and nuclear magnetic resonance. It will also include hands-on experience running programs on cloud quantum computers.
