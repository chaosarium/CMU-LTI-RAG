Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: Portraiture maintains a unique standing in photography for its direct and collaborative relationship between an individual and a photographer. This course will examine this relationship and the larger contexts which provide the conceptual framework for deriving meaning and understanding from an image of another person. We will study the theoretical and practical aspects of portrait photography in both studio and environmental settings, providing students with an understanding of the genre by developing both technical and conceptual skill sets. Students will utilize analog and digital equipment, learn studio lighting techniques, develop approaches to working with natural light, and explore methods of printing and presentation. Students will gain knowledge in the development of portraiture through the work of notable figures in the medium's history and contemporary field, including August Sander, Dorothea Lange, Walker Evans, Dawoud Bey, Milton Rogovin, Rineke Dijkstra, Zoe Strauss, Susan Lipper, Justine Kurland, Stefan Ruiz, Larry Sultan, Carrie Mae Weems, Roy DeCarava and Alec Soth. Class discussions, readings and critiques will provide an outline for completing both single and serial image assignments.
