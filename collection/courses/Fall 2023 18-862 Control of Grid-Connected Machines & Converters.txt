Course Description: Electric machines are the backbone of power systems, and any production process in the world. However, if uncontrolled or uncoordinated, they cause blackouts. Converters for renewables and electric vehicles are also challenging engineers to revisit and revise electric machine analysis and control. This course offers a classically-based, yet forward looking understanding of electric machines, converters, their operation, control and applications in vehicular technology and distributed generation, as well as their effects at system level.
