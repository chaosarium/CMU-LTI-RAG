Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: This laboratory course is designed to provide students with the ability to make measurements on and interpret data from living systems.  The experimental modules reinforce concepts from 42-101 Introduction to Biomedical Engineering and expose students to four areas of biomedical engineering: biomedical signal and image processing, biomaterials, biomechanics, and cellular and molecular biotechnology.  Several cross-cutting modules are included as well.  The course includes weekly lectures to complement the experimental component.      Prerequisites:  42-101 Introduction to Biomedical Engineering and 03-121 Modern Biology.  Pre-med students should register for 03-206.    Priority for enrollment will be given to students who have declared the Additional Major in Biomedical Engineering.
