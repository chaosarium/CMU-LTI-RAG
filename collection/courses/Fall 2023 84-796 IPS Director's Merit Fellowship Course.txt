Course Description: This 1-unit P/NP course is required for IPS Graduate Students who received a Director's Merit Fellowship upon admission to their program.

Fellows are expected to participate in a half-day orientation workshop at the beginning of their fellowship and then coordinate expectations and deliverables with their faculty supervisors each semester.  Faculty will assign mid-term and final grades; fellowships for the following semester will be re-assessed if a "NP" grade is issued.
