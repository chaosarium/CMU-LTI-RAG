Course Description: This music education course develops basic woodwind playing and teaching techniques for beginning and intermediate instrument classes. The course includes training in beginning band program design, aural & visual diagnosis of individual and ensemble playing problems, and methods of accelerating music reading independence in young players.  The course requires two off-campus field teaching experiences in local schools. Each field teaching experience will require about 3 hours to complete -- students should allow enough time in their schedules to complete this requirement.
