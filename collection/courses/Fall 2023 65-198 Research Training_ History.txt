Course Description: For Fall 2021: The Pittsburgh Queer History Project The Pittsburgh Queer History Project (PQHP) is an ongoing research effort to collect and catalog archival material that document the experiences of LGBTQ people in Pittsburgh and its environs from the second half of the 20th century to the present.   The PQHP is co-directed by Prof. Tim Haggerty, the Director of the Humanities Scholars Program and Dr. Harrison Apple, a BXA graduate of Carnegie Mellon who received a doctorate degree from the University of Arizona in 2021, studying with the noted trans scholar Susan Stryker.   Students will meet with community activists, learn how to conduct community outreach, organize archival material, and help formulate research questions based on these documents.   There is no prior experience needed.  The Dietrich College research training program is open to second-semester first-year students and sophomores with a 3.0 QPA or by petition. By permission of the relevant professor and the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Students sign up for these courses through both the History Department and the Dietrich College Dean's Office.
