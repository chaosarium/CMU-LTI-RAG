Course Description: This course introduces, in the context of physical systems, a variety of  mathematical tools and techniques that will be needed for later courses in  the physics curriculum. Topics will include linear algebra, Fourier series and transforms, vector calculus with physical applications, and a first look at partial differential equations. The techniques taught here are useful in more advanced courses such as Physical Mechanics, Electricity and Magnetism, and Advanced Quantum Physics.
