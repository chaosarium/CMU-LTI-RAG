Course Description: This course allows a student to gain biotechnology experience in a "real-world" setting. Internships vary widely in scope, but common to all is the chance to practice biotechnology skills acquired in the classroom. Typically, students seek and secure their own internships. Students are required to write written reflections summarizing their internship work and submit those to the course instructor.
