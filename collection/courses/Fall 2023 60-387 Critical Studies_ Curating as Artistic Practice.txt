Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: This seminar will explore various critical and inventive forms of "curating as a medium" in contemporary art. What happens to "curating" when it is used as a medium in and of itself? How have artists-as-curators, reversed power relations - challenged relationships between the collector and collected, between colonialism and collection - within and outside the spaces of museums, galleries, unauthorized venues, and cyberspace? We will read about and view exhibitions by artists that have challenged conventional curating modes, such as Fred Wilson's Mining the Museum, David Hammon's Charles W. White to Leonardo daVinci (MoMA), Ohad Meromi's Who is the Protagonist? (Guild and Greyshkul), Yto Barrada's A Raft (MoMA), Ryan Trecartin's Surround Audience (Triennial at the New Museum), Eve Fowler's and Lucas Michael's Artist Curated Projects: My Head is Falling Out, so I'm Standing on My Stomach (an apartment-based gallery in LA), Black Curators Collective's Meandering Networks, Mapping Nations (Glasgow International), and on-line exhibitions organized by artists such as Cory Arcangel, Miltos Manetas, Wolfgang Staehle, and Shu Lea Cheang, just to name a few. Members of this seminar will engage in several hands-on curating projects that will interact with and conduct research in local collections, such as the Carnegie, the August Wilson African American Cultural Center, the Warhol Museum, the Frick, the Mattress Factory, as well as excavating sites (physical and virtual; nationally and internationally) outside institutional walls.
