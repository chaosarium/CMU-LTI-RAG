Course Description: Movement II is a Lecoq-based course that weaves together three approaches to physical development: movement foundations, mime, and mask. Foundational work covers the basic principles and practices required to gain a solid physical technique as an actor: grounding, centering, balance, tension/relaxation, tempo variance, listening, levels of play, physical imagination, etc. Mime studies of dramatic action sequences such as pulling, pushing, climbing, throwing and classical mime illusion encourages economy and precision. Mask work conceals the face and reveals the body, forcing the actor to rely less on facial expressions and focus more on the stories being projected by the body. The main objective of this course is to encourage a disciplined mastery over bodily control and physical expression that has a direct application to playing a variety of theatrical styles. Limited to Acting/MT majors only.
