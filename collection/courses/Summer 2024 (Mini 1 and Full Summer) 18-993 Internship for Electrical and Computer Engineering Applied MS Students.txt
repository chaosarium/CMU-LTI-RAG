Course Description: The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering considers experiential learning opportunities as an important educational component for its graduate students. One such component is an internship completed during the course of the MS program. A member of the ECE Advising Group will add the course to the student's schedule. This process should be used by any Electrical and Computer Engineering graduate student who is enrolled in a program with a required internship component. International students should also be authorized by the Office of International Education (OIE). Completion of written assignments and requirements will determine the letter grade for the course. Students must have graduate standing in ECE, and an associated professional development course.
