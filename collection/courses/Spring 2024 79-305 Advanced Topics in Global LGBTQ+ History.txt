Course Description: In the half century since the Stonewall Uprising, a social revolution has occurred.  With Lesbians and Gay men have been accorded civil liberties and individual rights, Trans individuals have been recognized as a discrete minority, and the once rigid binaries of gender, sexuality and identity have become increasing labile and fluid.  Alongside these gains, there have been reversals, backlashes, and attacks against LGBTQ individuals both domestically and abroad, notably in the former Soviet Union, the Middle East, and emerging African nations as activists assume public identities and confront resistance and violence.  If these reversals have a common denominator, gay people have become identified as a constituency that suffers from sanctioned persecution.  This course will examine these contrapuntal movements and will utilize a series of case studies that focus on the emergence of a LGBTQ minority and examine them as political identities. These include the international case for gay marriage, the inclusion of gay men and women into armed forces, the impact of AIDS and the emergence of gay identities as political controversies in the Eastern Block, the Arab world, and African republics.   Please note:  This course is designed as an upper-level seminar, and seniors and juniors will be given priority in admission.
