Course Description: This course examines prominent classical and contemporary works in the two major subfields in American politics, political institutions and political behavior. This means the seminar will address topics such as Congress, presidency, bureaucracy, and courts, but also public opinion, elections, campaigns, political parties, and the importance of geography, wealth, ethnicity, gender, and religion in politics. There will be an emphasis on analyzing and appraising the theory, methodology, and contributions of the selected readings, and on discussing their complementarity. Intensive discussions and written essays are key components of the course.
