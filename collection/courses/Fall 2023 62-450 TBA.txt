Course Description: Learn flame shop essentials and a variety of creative techniques while working with a solid rod of glass. Using a propane/oxygen torch, students will learn to melt and manipulate glass into little treasures, such as beads, pendants, marbles, chains, and sculptures. Over the course of 8 weeks, learn color application, hand control, and annealing. The instructor will also provide one-on-one troubleshooting. Class tuition includes 2 hours of open-studio time to be used during the 8-week course period.
