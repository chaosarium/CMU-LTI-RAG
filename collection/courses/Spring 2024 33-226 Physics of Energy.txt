Course Description: This course will apply basic science, in particular introductory physics concepts, to a wide variety of topics related to energy. The course will closely follow a widely praised textbook The Physics of Energy, so be divided into 3 parts: basic energy science; energy sources; and climate. This course fills the breadth requirement for Physics Majors or can be used as one of the 4 electives required for the Applied Physics Track.
