Course Description: Great artists steal. This class is for writers of all skill levels interested in creating an adapted work. We will look at a range of different adaptations and discuss the choices the writers made -- from Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation of Thackeray's picaresque "The Luck of Barry Lyndon," to Sarah Ruhl's dreamlike theatrical retelling of the Orpheus and Eurydice myth.  You will leave this class with a toolkit for taking the shape of a story and making it your own, and with the first 10-30 pages of an original adapted work.
