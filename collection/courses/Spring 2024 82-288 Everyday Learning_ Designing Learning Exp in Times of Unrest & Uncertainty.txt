Course Description: Could you make complex ideas accessible and engaging to learners everywhere? Could you use what you know to make society better, teach as an agent of social change?  In these times of Covid-19 many people have used learning to stay connected with friends and communities, leading to a groundswell in teaching and learning online. In this course you will develop learning experiences using a variety of instructional methods in a range of contexts. Underpinning our work with ideas from philosophers and educators, we will explore the democratization of education in a post-Covid world and consider a shifting educational landscape inspired by the Black Lives Matter protests. We will look at the response from museums, libraries, cinemas, and civic spaces to better meet the diverse needs of learners in their communities. For our assessed projects, we will design and produce instructional videos, animation, audio content, paired with worksheets, talks, paper-based instructional materials.
