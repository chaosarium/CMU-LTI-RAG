Course Description: This course teaches students the basics of programming, sensors, motors, and control using a Romi robot. Students will also build a basic breadboard circuit and use real sensor data to navigate. The course lecture format will include instructional slides and teaching at the beginning of each lecture, followed by a brief lecture on how what we do in class connects to "real-world" robotics. This is followed by supervised programming time, where the instructors will answer questions and advise students working on labs. There is a $10 lab fee. If your financial situation makes this fee an obstacle to your participation in the class, please talk to the instructors.
