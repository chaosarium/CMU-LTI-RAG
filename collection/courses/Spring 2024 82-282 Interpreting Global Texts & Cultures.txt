Course Description: Literature, film, music, art, theater, and other forms of humanistic artistic expressions, play an important role in society. Few moments in life are as moving as listening to the right song at the right time, and many of us can list films and/or books that have shaped who we consider to be. Beyond the individual level, artistic expressions have also influenced revolutions, businesses, science, politics, and the list goes on and on. Yet, we often take culture and artistic expressions for granted. What is their role and value in society? How can we interpret these cultural artifacts? Is there a right or wrong interpretation? These are some of the questions we will explore in this class.
