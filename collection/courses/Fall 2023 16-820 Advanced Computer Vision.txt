Course Description: 16-820 is a required core course for MSCV students and is intended to move at a slightly faster pace compared to 16-720.  This course introduces the fundamental techniques used in computer vision, that is, the analysis of patterns in visual images to reconstruct and understand the objects and scenes that generated them. Topics covered include camera geometry and calibration, multi-view stereo, 3D reconstruction, image detection, segmentation, and tracking, and physics-based vision. The homeworks involve considerable Python programming exercises.
