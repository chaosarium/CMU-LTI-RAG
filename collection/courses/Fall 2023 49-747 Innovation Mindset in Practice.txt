Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: This course is for MIIPs advanced masters students only to take their thinking to the next level and assimilate what they know within a topic they explore in the context of an integrated approach to innovation. From the first day of classes through their summer internships + more, MIIPS students have been challenged to embrace ambiguity, trust in a human-centered, evidence based process, and think as creatively as possible on multidisciplinary teams. They have added new skills to their toolkits and new perspectives for how to "see" the world differently.  The challenge in this intensive class is to apply critical thinking, an innovative mindset, disciplined research, and a thoughtful use of tools/methods to a topic of each student's choosing within the innovation realm. And equally important, be self-directed and demonstrate the ability to communicate about it to other practitioners in meaningful ways. This course is only open to students in the MIIPS program.
