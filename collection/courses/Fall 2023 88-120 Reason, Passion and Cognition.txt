Course Description: How do we make decisions? Reason, Passion, and Cognition will be an introduction to the psychology of preference, judgment, and choice. Why do people behave in ways that cannot be defended as "rational" - and how do these deviations inform us about the processes that the mind uses to make fast-and-frugal decisions? The course will focus on the ways that cognitive and emotional processes relate to decisions made in the laboratory and in everyday decision making and will be based on rigorous experimental research.
