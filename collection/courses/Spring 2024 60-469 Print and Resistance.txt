Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: This course will explore how artists have used the multiple to resist and deconstruct dominant social and political narratives. Throughout history, printmaking has been used as an accessible tool by which to communicate ideas to the public, raising awareness about social issues and inspiring change. This course will ask students to consider the power in the collective nature of printmaking along with more subtle, process based methods of repetition. In a mechanized and digital world, how might the simple act of making by hand be a force of resistance? Students will explore the medium of printmaking both in technique and concept as a way to respond to issues of their time and voice alternative perspectives. This course will emphasize editionable methods such as lithography, risograph, and relief as well as painterly, one-of-a-kind techniques including monotype, pressure printing, and collagraph.
