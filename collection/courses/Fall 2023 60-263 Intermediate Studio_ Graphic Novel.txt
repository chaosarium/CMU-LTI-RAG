Course Description: In this course, students will critically and creatively engage with the medium of comics to learn how to better communicate their ideas in this format as well as challenge its boundaries. A substantial portion of the course will focus on familiarizing students with the basics of storytelling in a sequential narrative format and creating opportunities for students to discover, hone and explore their own voice and style. In addition to creating new work, students will also explore the history of comics and the origins of the "modern" graphic novel. Students will also be exposed to both graphic and non-graphic artists whose works has challenged and redefined the genre. We will explore these artists in order to understand how our own work borrows from and draws upon a rich lineage. Students will also be expected to think beyond the commonly accepted notions of comics and to question the relevancy of their work in this medium. Finally, each student will produce a new body of work that will culminate in the production of a 4-5 "page" "sequential" narrative.
