Course Description: Space systems contribute a great deal to America's security, prosperity, and quality of life.

The course is designed to investigate several interrelated themes, weaving together relevant aspects of technology, strategy, and policy.  The material is approached from both functional and historical perspectives, beginning with the basics of military and intelligence space operations and ending with an examination of the space- and cyber-related technical, strategic, and political challenges facing the nation today and in the foreseeable future.
