Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: Topics vary by semester. Fall 2023: Literature & Social Change - From the French Revolution to the beginning of the twentieth century, literature began to play an explosive role in the forces of political transition and the struggle for social justice. This course studies novels, poetry and prose in relation to both political and industrial revolutions during the rise of empire and capitalism and the road to climate change. We will study apocalyptic novels like Mary Shelley's The Last Man and novels of empire like Jane Eyre and its retelling in Wide Sargasso Sea; poetry about living in revolutionary times by Wordsworth and Phillis Wheatley Peters; and anti-capitalist anti-slavery writing such as Ottobah Cugoano's "Thoughts and Sentiments on the Evil of Slavery."
