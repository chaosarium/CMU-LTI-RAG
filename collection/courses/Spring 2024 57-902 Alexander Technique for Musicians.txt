Course Description: The Alexander Technique is a simple and proven method of self-care that helps to relieve the tension, stress, and pain caused by misuse of the body. It is based on the principal that "use affects functioning." By learning to be more aware of how they "use" themselves, students of the technique find they are able to make changes that allow them to perform daily tasks and activities with a new sense of freedom, balance, and support.  As a performing artist, you can use the Alexander Technique to help you prevent or manage common performance problems such as: stage fright, lack of poise or confidence, lack of breath control, vocal strain, and physical discomfort while practicing or performing.  The Alexander Technique offers relief from many physical problems that interfere with performing. This includes, but is not limited to, poor posture, headaches, jaw tension, and repetitive strain injuries.  The Alexander Technique lets you explore a fully conscious, improved way of using your breath, your voice, and your body. You will gain knowledge and understanding of your mental and physical resources, freeing your potential as a performer.
