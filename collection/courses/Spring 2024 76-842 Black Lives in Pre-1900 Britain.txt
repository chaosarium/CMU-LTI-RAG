Course Description: This course engages with Black voices writing from, to, about, and against Pre-1900 Britain, from abolitionists to actors to royalty. We explore topics including racial philosophy, the transatlantic slave trade, revolution, abolition, imperialism, and popular culture, from both contemporary and modern sources. Our texts and conversations trace how the lives and experiences of individuals like Ignatius Sancho, Sarah Baartman, Ira Aldridge, and Alemayehu Tewodros presage those of a modern global Black diaspora.
