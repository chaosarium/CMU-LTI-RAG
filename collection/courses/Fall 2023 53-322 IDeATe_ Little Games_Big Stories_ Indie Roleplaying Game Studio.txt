Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: With the media resurgence of tabletop and live action roleplaying, standards like Dungeons and Dragons and Vampire the Masquerade have gained more players thanks to popular streaming platforms. While these games have been a cultural touchstone, players have always gone out of their confines and into the thriving independent role playing games community. Producing unique forms of play, and exploring themes outside the realms of fantasy, indie games are bigger than ever.    This studio course aims to introduce students to the history and methods of creating independent analog roleplaying games in their many forms. Students will receive hands-on experience which aims to cultivate a praxis and practice as well as investigate the current art of independent roleplaying games. Focusing on analog roleplaying games across the current indie design spectrum (storytelling, tabletop, journaling, and larp), students will split their time between playing games and critically learning from their form and creating their own games. At the end of the semester, students will submit their work in the form of a self-published roleplaying zine. There will be opportunities for students to receive feedback from current industry practitioners in critique sessions. No game writing or design experience is necessary to join this course.
