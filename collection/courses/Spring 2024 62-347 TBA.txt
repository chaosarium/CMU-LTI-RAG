Course Description: Enroll in Hot 2 and build on your existing skill set and expand your creative potential. Refine and diverge from the standard cup and bowl shape in the first few weeks before moving on to more complex forms. Explore basic color application methods and learn how to troubleshoot common problems. It is recommended that all students take this class a second time in order to continue to develop and refine basic skills before moving on to Advanced Hot Glass. 2 free (1 hour) rental sessions per student are included with tuition to Hot Glass 2. Rental time is purposefully included with this 8-week course to give students independent studio time to practice the skills demonstrated in class and prepare students to feel comfortable renting the hot shop if desired. Using rental session(s) contributes to final grade for CMU students. Students must attend at least one rental session (in addition to their 8 classes) to receive an A in this course. Studio rental is scheduled based around student schedule and studio availability. Hot I, 24 hours of hot shop experience, or instructor permission is required. Registration can only be done on your scheduled registration day and is done on a first come, first serve basis. Please email Stefanie McGowan (stefanim@andrew.cmu.edu) for more information and to register. Spaces are limited. Course fee is $300. Not eligible for PCHE cross registration. Course taught at the Pittsburgh Glass Center. Courses at the Pittsburgh Glass Center run from February 6th- April 7th.
