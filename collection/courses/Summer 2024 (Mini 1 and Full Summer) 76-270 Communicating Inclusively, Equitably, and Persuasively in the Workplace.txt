Course Description: Strong writing and communication skills are expected across the professions, from computer science to data science, from healthcare to engineering. This course is designed to help students in these and other professions build skills and confidence in written, oral, and team communication. Our guiding, research-based premise for the course is that readers in professional contexts are busy, actively look for the information they need, and deserve to get that information in a clear and accessible way. In this course, you will strengthen your writing and communication skills through a series of projects that put real readers and users of documents at the center your writing process. Through genres like job application packages, proposals, presentations of complex information for non-experts, and team-based technical documentation, you will practice the skills you will need as you move from student writer to professional. The course is writing intensive, and requires regular participation and attendance. This course is designed for all undergraduates pursuing majors and minors outside English, and has no pre-requisites beyond First Year Writing. Please note: ALL seniors, regardless of major/minor, will be waitlisted in an effort to accommodate those for whom the course is required to graduate.
