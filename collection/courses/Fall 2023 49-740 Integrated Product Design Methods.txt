Course Description: This studio-style course covers the critical thinking, processes, frameworks, methodologies, artifacts and deliverables typically associated with innovative product development. In particular, students will learn the Integrated Product Development (IPD) process used in the MIIPS program: identifying, understanding, conceptualizing, and realizing a product (or service) opportunity.  Working individually and in teams, students will be challenged through case histories, mini-lectures, readings, a variety of hands-on exercises, assessments and project prompts. In addition, students will gain professional practice communicating within teams to further the work and to potential stakeholders about key decision points. This course is only open to students in the MIIPS program.
