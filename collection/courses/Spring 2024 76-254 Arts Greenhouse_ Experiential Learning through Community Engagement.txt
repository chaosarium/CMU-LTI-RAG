Course Description: This course is designed to provide students with hands-on, in-person experience in designing and implementing a community engagement project in partnership with Arts Greenhouse.  CMU students will analyze their prospective student audience and create a humanities-based project with a final product to share locally with sixth- through eighth-grade Arts Greenhouse students.  CMU students will engage in task analysis to break down all the steps their partner students will have to follow to create the final product/project.  Students in this course will also explore the highlights of teaching methodology to prepare them with the necessary tools to reach their middle school audience.  As a culmination of the course, college students will implement these projects in Arts Greenhouse partner schools.  Additionally, CMU students will put into practice the leadership skills necessary to build working relationships with community partners.
