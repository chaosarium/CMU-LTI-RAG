Course Description: Roman civilization was a famous and powerful ancient civilization, however its details are not regularly taught in schools. Moreover, even when it's taught, instructors often weigh too much on the historical timeline and take its culture for granted. In this course we will look into Ancient Rome through multiple lenses, including history, politics, warfare, society, culture, etc. We hope that through this course students will have a broad and more complete view of the ancient Roman civilization. We will also correct misinformations of Ancient Rome by popular media. This course will be conducted in a non-academic manner and it's fun and informative!
