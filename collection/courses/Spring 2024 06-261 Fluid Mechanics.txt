Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: The principles of fluid mechanics as applied to engineering, including unit operations, are discussed; examples include flow in conduits, process equipment, and commercial pipes, flow around submerged objects, and flow measurement. Microscopic mass and momentum balances are described, including the continuity and Navier-Stokes equations, and modern solution techniques will be explored. Microscopic flow structures will be determined for flow visualization. Boundary layer theory, turbulence, and non-Newtonian fluids are also discussed. A case-study project based on new technological advancements is also required.
