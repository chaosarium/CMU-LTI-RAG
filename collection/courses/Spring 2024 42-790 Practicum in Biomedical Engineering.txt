Course Description: Students will work with a faculty member, local biomedically-oriented company or local clinical researcher on a technical research, development or outreach project. A faculty member affiliated with the Department of Biomedical Engineering will either serve as the advisor for an internal project or as a liaison for an external industrial/clinical project. The project will culminate in an internally-archived written report which documents the project and its results. The report will be reviewed by the faculty advisor/liaison; this review, together with feedback from the project manager, will serve as the basis for the assignment of the course grade. Pre-requisite: Students need to receive departmental approval after submitting the Application for BME Practicum Course form.  Graduate standing and consent of faculty advisor/liaison is also required. Variable units. See BME Practicum website (https://www.cmu.edu/bme/Intranet/Graduate%20Portal%20/practicum.html) for details.
