Course Description: The course brings forward cybernetic epistemology, concepts, and models that bridge machine intelligence and the evolution of 21st-century architectural/design practice. The dominance of 多artificial intelligence多, especially with the substitution of machine learning for the broader meanings of AI and more so for 多machine intelligence多, has created a severely limited view of what computation can afford architecture/design, as well as the rapidly evolving techno-culture, and no less society and culture more broadly.
