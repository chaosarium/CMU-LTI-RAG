Course Description: We will emphasize technical aspects of traditional and performative drawing Â¿ that is the compulsion to leave tangible traces of our presence. The sensual interaction of body as instrument in contact with a surface will be explored and analyzed as we develop our perceptual, conceptual and imaginative skills.   Experimentation in and devotion to our studio practice will extend our capabilities and heighten our sensitivity to a diverse range of materials and methods of mark making and rendering.   Scratching, scraping, scoring, caressing, stroking, burnishing, brushing, dragging, wiping, scrubbing and erasing are some of the means through which we will record our observations, thoughts and feelings on a wide range on substrates.   Formal presentations, technical demonstrations, visiting lectures, museum trips, and film screenings complement studio time devoted toward independent and class projects.   Material fee for reduces cost for special papers and supplies like silver point, traditional gesso, large paper rolls etc.
