Course Description: This course provides an overview and introduction to the field of human-computer interaction (HCI). It introduces students to tools, techniques, and sources of information about HCI and provides a systematic approach to design. The course increases awareness of good and bad design through observation of existing technology and teaches the basic skills of generative and evaluative research methods. This is a companion course to courses in visual design (51-422) and software implementation (05-430, 05-431).    When registering for this course, undergraduate students are automatically placed the wait list. Students will be then moved into the class, based on if they are in the BHCI second major and year in school e.g. seniors, juniors, etc    In the Fall, this course is NOT open to students outside the HCI major.  The Spring offering is open to all students. This course is a core requirement for students in the HCI additional major.
