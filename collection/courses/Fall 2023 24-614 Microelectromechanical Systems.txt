Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: This course introduces fabrication and design fundamentals for Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS): on-chip sensor and actuator systems having micron-scale dimensions.  Basic principles covered include microstructure fabrication, mechanics of silicon and thin-film materials, electrostatic force, capacitive motion detection, fluidic damping, piezoelectricity, piezoresistivity, and thermal micromechanics.  Applications covered include pressure sensors, micromirror displays, accelerometers, and gas microsensors.  Grades are based on exams and homework assignments.
