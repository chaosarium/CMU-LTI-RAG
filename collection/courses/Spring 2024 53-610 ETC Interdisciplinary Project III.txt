Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: Project courses have teams of 3-8 students work on a focused project during that semester. The number of projects per semester will vary. The primary objective of the courses is to provide a hands-on working experience with teammates who are from different backgrounds and disciplines. Other objectives are to experience project management, and have the possibility of working with an external client (some projects have externally collaborators). The requirements for a project are that: - the team contain students from various backgrounds - the team must prototype and produce a tangible artifact (not a paper) - the work must be supervised by a faculty project instructor approved by the ETC for this project
