Course Description: This course provides a rigorous and proof-based treatment of functions of one real variable. The Real Number System:  Field and order axioms, sups and infs, completeness, integers and rational numbers. Real Sequences:  Limits, cluster points, limsup and liminf, subsequences, monotonic sequences, Cauchy's criterion, Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem. Topology of the Real Line: Open sets, closed sets, density, compactness, Heine-Borel Theorem. Continuity: attainment of extrema, Intermediate Value Theorem, uniform continuity. Differentiation:  Chain Rule, local extrema, Mean-Value Theorems, L'Hospital's Rule, Taylor's Theorem. Riemann Integration:  Partitions, upper and lower integrals, sufficient conditions for integrability, Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Sequences of Functions:  Pointwise convergence, uniform convergence, interchanging the order of limits.  The course presumes some mathematical sophistication including the ability to recognize, read, and write proofs.  (Three 50 minute lectures)
