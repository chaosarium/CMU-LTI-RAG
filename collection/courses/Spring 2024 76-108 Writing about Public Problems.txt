Course Description: If all problems required a simple fix, we could don our Avenger costumes, pick up Thors hammer, and right the worlds wrongs. But most problems arent so simple. Most of the problems we encounter require careful investigation and research so that we might propose solutions that connect with others to make change. In this 76101 class (one of two minis students can choose to fulfill their FYW requirement), we will learn how public problems are defined and argued across a range of texts, including proposals, op-ed genres, and white papers. By analyzing a range of proposal texts, we will identify the different kinds of legwork necessary to write a successful proposal, arguably one of the most challenging aspects of writing a persuasive recommendation for change. We will examine how writers unpack problems rhetorically and use evidence to argue solutions for different stakeholders who may not share common values. We will learn strategies for evaluating and synthesizing data from existing research to use in a proposal argument. By the end of the course, students will write their own proposal that recommends a solution and a feasible plan for solving a real problem.
