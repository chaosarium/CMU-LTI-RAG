Course Description: This lecture course introduces the foundational concepts and techniques of programming language semantics. The aim is to demonstrate the utility of a scientific approach, based on mathematics and logic, with applications to program analysis, language design, and compiler correctness. We focus on the most widely applicable frameworks for semantic description: denotational, operational, and axiomatic semantics. We use semantics to analyze program behavior, guide the development of correct programs, prove correctness of a compiler, validate logics for program correctness, and derive general laws of program equivalence. We will discuss imperative and functional languages, sequential and parallel, as time permits.
