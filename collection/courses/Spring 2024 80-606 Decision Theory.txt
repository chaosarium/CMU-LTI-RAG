Course Description: This course is an introduction to formal models of choice and decision-making. We begin by examining choice under certainty, developing both qualitative and quantitative models of preference. We then expand our analysis to take into account uncertainty, focusing on the von Neumann-Morgenstern theory of expected utility and Savage's classic axioms. Empirical challenges to models are emphasized throughout, in response to which we will consider a variety of alternative representations of uncertainty (e.g., Dempster-Shafer belief functions, non-unique probability measures) and preference (e.g., framing effects, prospect theory).
