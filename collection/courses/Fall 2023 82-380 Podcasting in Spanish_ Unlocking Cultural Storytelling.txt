Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: F23: In this course, students will learn about the various characteristics and possibilities of podcasting, and will familiarize themselves with the history, tenets, and examples of cultural storytelling for Spanish-speaking communities using this medium. Likewise, they will get involved hands-on in production learning while creating a series of podcasts that explore the linguistic and cultural landscapes of the local Spanish-speaking community in Pittsburgh, supporting diversity and giving voice to their stories as rich, intimate, and immersive audio experiences. Students will blend studio recordings with interviews and/or suitable "found" recordings, music, and sound.Assigned texts for this course will include primary and secondary sources related to classic examples of community radio such as Radio Venceremos and Radio Rebelde, and episodes from diverse and successful podcasts including Radio Ambulante, Entre Am√©ricas, and La Brega. We will also engage with materials in which radio and podcasting play a pivotal role. While advancing on Spanish linguistic and cultural proficiency, students will develop research and analytic skills in the target language, learn about the Spanish-speaking community in Pittsburgh, and engage in meaningful interactions with its members. Coursework will include skills development on audio recording and podcasting, production management, creative thinking, materials sourcing, and giving and receiving constructive feedback from classmates and varied audiences on team and individual projects. No previous podcasting experience is necessary, but experience in writing, interviewing, music production, or digital editing would be helpful. Anyone with an interest in podcasting or issues of immigration, bilingualism, and civil rights is encouraged to participate. The course will be taught in Spanish.
