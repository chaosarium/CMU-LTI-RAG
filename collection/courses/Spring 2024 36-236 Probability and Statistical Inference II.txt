Course Description: This class is the second half of a two-semester, calculus-based course sequence that introduces theoretical aspects of probability and statistical inference to students. The material in this course and in 36-235 (Probability and Statistical Inference I) is organized so as to provide repeated exposure to essential concepts: the courses cover specific probability distributions and their inferential applications one after another, starting with the normal distribution and continuing with the binomial and Poisson distributions, etc. Topics specifically covered in 36-236 include the binomial and related distributions, the Poisson and related distributions, and the uniform distribution, and how they are used in point and interval estimation, hypothesis testing, and regression. Also covered in 36-236 are topics related to multivariate distributions: marginal and conditional distributions, covariance, and conditional distribution moments. All discussion is supplemented with computer-based examples and exercises (e.g., visualization and simulation). Given its organization, the course is only appropriate for those who first take 36-235, and thus it is currently open only to statistics majors (primary, additional, dual) and minors, as well as to CS majors using both 36-235 and 36-236 to complete their probability requirement. All others are directed to take 36-226. A grade of C or better in 36-236 is required in order to advance to 36-401.
