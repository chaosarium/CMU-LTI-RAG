Course Description: The goal of this course is to prepare PhD students to engage in the CS community, even as our community evolves to put more emphasis on Justice, Equity, Diversity & Inclusion (JEDI). This evolution is reflected in the increasing expectations of students to engage meaningfully with JEDI concepts on department committees, in student groups, and on job applications. https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15996/
