Course Description: The course is targeted at entrepreneurs and innovators who are interested in introducing innovations to the marketplace through start-up, emerging and established organizations.  Class participants will learn how to evaluate, develop and implement opportunities for innovation, using an emergent or iterative approach (the lean methodology). Students will also learn a variety of methodologies to identify opportunities for innovation including how to identify unserved customers, identifying what jobs customers need to do, and how to incorporate innovations originating from end users, suppliers, materials manufacturers, and other entities outside the firm.  Students will learn how to develop a Business Model, identify a Minimum Viable Product, and a Market Entry Point.    The course is divided into two parts.  In the first half students will be exposed to theories and strategies of innovation through readings and case studies.  In the second half students will identify and develop their own product concept utilizing concepts developed in the first part of the course, and step-by-step develop their business model, organizational plan, strategic partners, marketing message, sales plan, and financing strategy. This course may use third-party course material that is not available for individual purchase from the publisher.   If so, the third-party course material will be secured and provided by the Tepper School to students enrolled in the course, and students enrolled in the course will be required to pay to the University the associated additional course materials fee for the third-party course material provided.   The amount of the course materials fee is dependent on the University's cost of the particular materials provided, and typically ranges from $13 to $75.
