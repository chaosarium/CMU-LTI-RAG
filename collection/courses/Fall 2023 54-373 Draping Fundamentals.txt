Course Description: Draping Fundamentals is a half-semester introduction to the arena of the costume draper. This course illustrates what the draper's role is in effectively spearheading garment production for the performing arts, emphasizing the collaboration skills needed to propel a design from page to stage. The course instills a strong foundation in pattern development skills through the use of the dress or suit stand. Additional skills such as application of research, fitting procedures and protocol, pattern manipulations and refinements and complete construction plans are explored. This class provides tangential learning through a thorough investigation of sculptural and spatial relationships, emphasis on strategic planning, development of fine motor skills, and exposure to a broad spectrum of materials and methods that can be adapted to other purposes.
