Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: The eleven symphonic works of Mahler will be analyzed in relation to their form, melodic and harmonic content, counterpoint, orchestration, program, and emotional content. Further topics of discussion will be Mahler?s use of beauty sentimentality, banality, tragedy, irony, and humor to present the ?Whole Truth? in his symphonic writing. The class will be very interactive with each student expected to make an oral presentation and write a research paper on a symphony of their choice.  This course can count as music support for graduate students (and undergraduate students).  Undergraduate students may register with instructor permission if space is available after graduate students have registered.
