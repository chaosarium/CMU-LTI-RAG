Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: This course is a seven-week national security simulation run in coordination with Valens Global in which students will have an assigned role as a state or non-state actor and work within teams to develop policy responses to a security crisis that changes and develops over time, in response to team moves and other factors. The simulation changes each year but generally involves great power competition, directly and through non-state actor proxies. Participants will need to gain an understanding of the facts through a complex information environment that is polluted with misinformation that allows actors to engage in manipulation and deception. Students will learn how to analyze national security problems, develop and analyze options, advocate for their position, negotiate, and work within a team, as well as with other teams.
