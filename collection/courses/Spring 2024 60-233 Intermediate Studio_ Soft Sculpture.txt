Course Description: Soft Sculpture is an intermediate studio course that explores the concepts, fabrication techniques, and history behind the creation of sculptural works of art made with fabric, fibers, and soft materials. In this class, we will discuss and demonstrate intermediate sewing and seaming techniques; pattern-making and pattern-following techniques for shapes, experimental forms, and garments; needle-felting and wet felting for wool; loop and cut pile tufting; inkjet printing on fabric; and some basics of weaving, and / or knitting / crochet, as well as embroidery, all with special attention to combining both hand-making and digital techniques when applicable. Projects in this class may include, but not be limited to: fabric forms with armatures; inflatables; stuffed forms; puppets and kinetic soft sculpture; wearables / garments / costumes; woven, tufted, or embroidered tapestries and quilts; and a variety of other experimental soft sculptures. As a class, we will discuss and share relevant art historical and contemporary examples of artists and artworks making use of fabric and fibers, as well as relevant texts and theory. Concepts explored as a group include the transformation of 2d pattern to 3D form; relationship of wearable works to the body and performance; the history of fabric and fiber craft in relationship to gender studies and underrecognized craftspeople; and ideas surrounding transformation and the relationship between craft and technology.
