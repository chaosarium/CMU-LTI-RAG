Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: This course is an introduction to the Rust programming language, a memory-safe systems programming language. We will cover a range of topics, from the Rust borrow checker to parallelism and the unsafe keyword. Outside of class, there will be basic programming exercises, and during the second half of the semester there will be a small student-defined project. This course is taught in Rust, and you are not expected to have any prior exposure to Rust. However, this course assumes knowledge of topics covered by 15-122. Knowledge of functional programming idioms taught in 15-150, as well as knowledge of systems programming taught in 15-213 is a bonus, but not strictly required.
