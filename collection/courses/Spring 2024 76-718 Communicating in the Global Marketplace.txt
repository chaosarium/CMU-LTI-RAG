Course Description: Effective intercultural and global communication has become increasingly salient in today's hyper-connected world, simultaneously presenting us with challenges and rewards. A vivid thread that unspools once one begins to unravel the embroidery of intercultural and global communication in contemporaneous times is computer-mediated communication (CMC) and social media. With more than half of the world's population connected to the Internet, we are more connected than ever. But, despite how seamless the Internet may have made communication, the fact that language is rooted in culture complicates CMC, even if the language is English.   The omnipresence of English leads people to assume that a common language implies a shared understanding of a given topic. But, speaking the same language does not mean we share the same cultural values, or that we even understand or are aware of other cultural values and beliefs. English may be the lingua franca in many organizations and professional settings, but the commingling of globalization and CMC raises some questions including "How can professional communicators contribute to shaping a workplace discourse that transcends national or regional borders to reach a global audience"?   This course will address these questions by explaining the specific ways in which our backgrounds (from personal to social and even national) influence professional and technical communication; the impact of globalization on the workplace, especially in times of crisis; and the ways in which we can rely on general concepts and principles in order to communicate effectively in specific international settings and situations.
