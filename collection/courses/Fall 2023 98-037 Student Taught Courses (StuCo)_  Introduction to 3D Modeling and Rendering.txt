Course Description: During this Stuco, I hope to introduce students to the vast realm of 3D modeling. During the span of this course, I hope to teach students how to use the free 3D modeling software called Blender. To do so, I want to introduce students to the 4 main components of 3D modeling: lighting, geometric manipulation (vertices, edges, and faces), rendering, texturing and basic animation. In addition, I want to make this course project-based so students can explore a variety of rendering styles (for instance, photorealistic, minimalistic, etc.) and also give students the freedom to explore which area of 3D modeling they are particularly interested in (product engineering, architectural/space visualization, character design, etc.).
