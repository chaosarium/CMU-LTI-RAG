Course Description: Successful fundraising is critical to the effective operations of every nonprofit organization in the United States. This course will introduce students to the context and practice of American philanthropy, the principles of donor-centered fundraising, and the roles and responsibilities of professional fundraisers and fundraising staff in nonprofit arts organizations. The course will begin with a brief history of philanthropy in the United States, its evolution, and the legal framework involved in accepting financial gifts. We will then explore the sources of contributed funds, solicitation strategies, individual motivations to give, effective donor communications, and donor cultivation and stewardship. Special topics will address new and emerging fundraising techniques, ethical issues, and the increased expectations donors have regarding fundraising accountability and engagement in nonprofit organizations.
