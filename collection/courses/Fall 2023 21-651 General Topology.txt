Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: Metric spaces: continuity, compactness, Arzela-Ascoli Theorem, completeness and completion, Baire Category Theorem. General topological spaces: bases and subbases, products, quotients, subspaces, continuity, topologies generated by sets of functions, homeomorphisms. Convergence: nets, filters, and the inadequacy of sequences. Separation: Hausdorff spaces, regular spaces, completely regular spaces, normal spaces, Urysohn's Lemma, Tietze's Extension Theorem. Connectedness. Countability conditions: first and second countability, separability, Lindelof property. Compactness: Tychonoff's Theorem, local compactness, one-point compactification.
