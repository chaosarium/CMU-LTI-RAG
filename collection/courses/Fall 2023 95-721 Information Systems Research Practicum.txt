Course Description: The IS project course provides students an exciting opportunity to apply skills they develop in the classroom to a problem from a real world context. In doing so students begin to make the transition from their academic world to the environments in which they will work once they graduate. In these environments the challenges of team building resource development client relations limited information and pressing deadlines are as real and important as the technical and managerial components of any task.    The project is a semester long intensive team-based experience focusing on one of the specialization areas available in the MISM program. A typical project course includes design and development of an information system for an external client - often a corporation or public agency. Each project results in a final report/document as well a demonstration a prototype a significant portion of a larger system or a finished system.
