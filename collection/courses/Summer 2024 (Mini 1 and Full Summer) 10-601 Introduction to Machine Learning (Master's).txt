Course Description: Machine Learning (ML) develops computer programs that automatically improve their performance through experience.   This includes learning many types of tasks based on many types of experience, e.g. spotting  high-risk medical patients, recognizing speech, classifying text  documents, detecting credit card fraud, or driving autonomous vehicles.   10601 covers all or most of: concept learning, decision trees, neural networks, linear learning, active learning, estimation & the bias-variance tradeoff, hypothesis testing, Bayesian learning, the MDL principle, the Gibbs classifier, Naive Bayes, Bayes  Nets & Graphical Models, the EM algorithm, Hidden Markov Models, K-Nearest-Neighbors and nonparametric learning, reinforcement learning,  bagging, boosting and discriminative training.   Grading will be based on weekly or biweekly assignments (written and/or programming), a midterm, a final exam, and possibly a project (details may vary depending on the section).  10601 is recommended for quantitative master's & PhD students outside MLD.    Prerequisites (strictly enforced): strong quantitative aptitude, college prob&stats; course, and programming proficiency.  For learning to apply ML practically & effectively, without the above prerequisites, consider 11344/05834 instead. If you are unsure whether you have sufficient mathematical background to do well in this course, you should consider taking the minis 10-606 and 10-607 Mathematical and Computational Foundations for Machine Learning. You can find a link to the Intro to ML course comparison page, which includes a self-assessment exam to help you choose which Intro to ML course to take, in the Course URL field.
