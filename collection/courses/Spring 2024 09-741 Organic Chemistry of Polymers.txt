Course Description: A study of the synthesis and reactions of high polymers. Emphasis is on practical polymer preparation and on the fundamental kinetics and mechanisms of polymerization reactions. Topics include: relationship of synthesis and structure, step-growth polymerization, chain-growth polymerization via  radical, ionic and coordination intermediates, copolymerization, discussions of specialty polymers and reactions of polymers. Students in 09-741 will take the same lectures and the same exams as those enrolled in 09-502 but, in addition, will prepare a term paper on the topic of advanced polymeric materials, to be approved by the instructor. 09-509 or 09-715, Physical Chemistry of Macromolecules, is excellent preparation for this course but is not required. 3-6 hrs. lec.
