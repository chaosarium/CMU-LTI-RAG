You'll uncover echoes of lives and traditions, crafting compelling narratives mirroring intricate tapestries of language, identity, and shared history. You'll learn writing, shooting, and editing, weaving personal experiences into films. Amidst storytelling traditions, you'll explore representation, listening to stories from our communities, whispers and echoes from the past. Ongoing assessment, tied closely to a formal production process, culminating with a public screening; your documentaries should portray people's lives, reflect aspects of community, and engage with important social issues.
