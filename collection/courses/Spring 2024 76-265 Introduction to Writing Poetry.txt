Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: Section A: Now more than ever, art is a necessary tool to make sense of the world around us. This course is meant to serve as an introduction to the craft of poetry, one of the oldest and most enduring forms of writing. We'll look closely at traditional poetic forms as well as examine the craft choices of modern and contemporary poets to expand our understanding of poetic approaches. You will read published work and the work of your classmates with a critical eye, will write your own poems, both formal and not, and will hone your ability to speak knowledgeably about poetry. We'll also spend time examining trends in contemporary American poetics, attending poetry events virtually, and completing in-class writing exercises. This class is meant to be both instructive and fun. What you learn here will pave the way for your future as both a reader and a writer of poetry.   Section B: This course is not only an introduction to the writing of poetry, but to the English/American history and reading of it as well. Our discussions will concern diction, scansion and metrics, and the image-making process. Requirements are to complete weekly library and writing assignments, to read published work, to consider the work of your classmates and to create your own workÂ¿ in both prose and poetry. During the semester there will be three examinations during class time and, at the end of the semester, a final project to consist of work completed during the course.
