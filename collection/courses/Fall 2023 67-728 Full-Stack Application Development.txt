Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: Web 2.0, Mashups, Mobile Apps, and Cloud Computing are just a few of the new terms people are using to describe emerging technologies for building complex, distributed applications. Protocol standards, web services, open-APIs, increasingly more powerful mobile devices, and the Internet have enabled new possibilities for weaving complex applications using globally-distributed data and computing resources. Application development has largely left any single computer, and is distributed across a wide range of hardware and software platforms. This class will explore these developing technologies and models for structuring their complexity, while building projects that go from mobile to the cloud.
