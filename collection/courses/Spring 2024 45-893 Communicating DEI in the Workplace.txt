Course Description: When choosing whom to work for, employees are seeking companies that value and commit to the principles of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (Poets & Quants, 2021). DEI work is not only the right thing to do; it also drives business results. This course is designed to give students an appreciation for DEI practices as they learn to apply those principles in their own organizations. Students will consider ways to communicate the concepts and applications of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion from the hiring process and into the workplace, including teamwork, interpersonal interactions, and innovation.
