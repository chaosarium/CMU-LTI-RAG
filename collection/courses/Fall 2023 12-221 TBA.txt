Course Description: Environmental chemistry is foundational to the understanding of processes in natural and engineered systems. This course introduces environmental chemistry principles within the context of air and water systems. It focuses on the use of stoichiometry, thermodynamics, equilibrium, and kinetics to understand processes governing chemical and biological behaviors in natural and engineered systems. Topics in water include acid-base chemistry, the carbonate system, buffering, oxidation and reduction, mineral dissolution/precipitation, metal complexation, adsorption, and partitioning.  Topics in air and climate to be discussed include atmospheric chemistry, air quality, combustion, aerosols, and climate science.
