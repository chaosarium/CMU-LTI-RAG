Course Description: Cities all around the world are being built and re-invented as smart cities utilizing information systems and innovative applications of data analytics.  One major smart cities component is transportation.  The Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) industry is expected to grow at a rate of 9% per year and reach $45 Billion in annual investment by 2023 (Greenenergy24, 2017).  This shifting dynamic provides great opportunity for improved transportation safety and efficiency but also poses challenging information systems and public policy challenges. Furthermore, there are new opportunities for professional-school graduates outside of engineering schools for employment in transportation planning and policy.  This course is supported by CMU's Traffic21 Institute Mobility21 National University Transportation Center.  Classes will feature guest lectures provided by Traffic21/Mobility21 faculty and industry and government ITS professionals.
