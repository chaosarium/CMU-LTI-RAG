Course Description: This course is for Sophomore Actors only. This course not only sharpens their skills as ensemble performers, but also allows for more playfulness, creativity and exploration, cultivating risk-taking and a certain abandon. The course concentrates on non-verbal psychological improv, helping actors achieve a kind of physical truth and spontaneity, while becoming aware of the importance of the body in conveying information.
