Course Description: Mathematics is a central part of our intellectual experience. It is connected to sophisticated philosophical perspectives, say, in the work of Plato, Descartes, Leibniz, Kant, as well as in contemporary analytic philosophy; it is equally connected to fundamental views in the sciences, say, in the work of Ptolemy, Galileo, Newton, Einstein, as well as in contemporary cosmology. The common view that mathematics - if not directly "static" - is evolving in a linear fashion, does not withstand historical scrutiny. Indeed, there are many dramatic conceptual changes concerning the very nature and object of mathematics.
