Course Description: Negotiation is a critical skill that is essential for success in today's world. Decision-makers use negotiation to reach agreements with co-workers, bosses, clients, service providers, subordinates, firms, family, roommates, and friends. Regardless of one's career path, learning how to negotiate effectively is important. This course provides a systematic and insightful approach to negotiation - the art and science of securing agreements between interdependent parties. Through experiential exercises, students will learn to analyze the features of the negotiation environment, develop an understanding of effective negotiation strategies and tactics, and identify the behavioral barriers and psychological factors that may prevent decision-makers from reaching wise agreements. The exercises, which feature negotiations in a variety of contexts including business negotiations, salary negotiations, interpersonal negotiations, and team negotiations, are designed to provide students with an opportunity to practice new strategies in a low-risk environment, receive feedback, and apply new knowledge to subsequent exercises. In-class discussions and lectures will complement the exercises, allowing students to explore and apply theoretical concepts to practical scenarios. This course is appropriate for students of any major who are interested in refining their negotiation skills.
