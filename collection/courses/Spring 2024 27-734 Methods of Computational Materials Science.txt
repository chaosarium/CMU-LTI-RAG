Course Description: This course introduces students to the theory and practice of computational materials science  from the electronic to the microstructural scale. Both the underlying physical models and their  implementation as computational algorithms will be discussed. Topics will include:  Density functional theory Molecular dynamics Monte Carlo methods Phase field models Cellular automata Data science  Examples and homework problems will be taken from all areas of materials science. Coursework  will utilize both software packages and purpose-built computer codes. Students should be comfortable  writing, compiling, and running simple computer programs in MatLab, Python, or comparable environment.
