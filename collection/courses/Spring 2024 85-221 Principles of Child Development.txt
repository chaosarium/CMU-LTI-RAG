Course Description: The goal of this course is to provide an introduction to the study of developmental psychology from conception through the onset of adolescence in both a cultural and historical context. The emphasis is on basic concepts and theories of child growth and development as these apply to the psychological processes of perception, cognition, emotion, social interactions, and brain and body development, all with a focus on the effects of nature and nurture, individual differences, and the role of society in facilitating change.  In addition to learning basic developmental concepts, you will learn various research designs and procedures that have been used in the research literature. Students also learn about existing controversies in the literature and are therefore encouraged to view developmental psychology as an evolving discipline.
