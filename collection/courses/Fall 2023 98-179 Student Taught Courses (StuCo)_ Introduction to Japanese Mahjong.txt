Course Description: Japanese Mahjong, also known as Riichi Mahjong, is a variation of Mahjong that had attracted worldwide popularity. Compare to most other variants, Japanese Mahjong emphasizes strategies and intellect over luck, making it very suitable as a competitive sport. This course introduces students to the rules and manners of Japanese Mahjong, as well as advanced strategies that would let you play like a pro. We will also set up a tournament toward the end of the semester, and the winner may get a prize! No prior knowledge of Mahjong is required, but experienced players may also learn something new and get a chance to play competitively. We will provide Mahjong sets to play face-to-face, but we also encourage students to purchase their own sets to help with our budget.
