Course Description: This class will combine both economic and business topics.  The class will contain applied microeconomics topics focused on resource allocation and efficiency in different market structures.  We will explore perfect competition, monopoly and monopolistic competition and oligopic market structures.  We will also explore macro-economic ideas so as to understand the context within which businesses operate.  It is anticipated that these topics will occupy 1/3 of the class.  The other 2/3 of the class will focus on business management from an applied, integrated view.  The majority of the business topics will involve team based work.
