Course Description: The Exploded Ensemble is a group dedicated to the performance of music that pushes the boundaries of traditional performance and composition.  The ensemble has a strong emphasis on electro-acoustic performance technique, experimental approaches to staging and amplification, and ¿visuals¿ (live video, computer controlled lighting, wearable technology, etc.).   The group will perform works by new/experimental/electro-acoustic composers and will create new arrangements of works for which scores may not currently exist - for example, music by rock bands, electronic musicians, and sound artists.   The overall goal of the ensemble is to explode the idea of traditional concert music performance.  In so doing we shall advance student skills in music performance, music appreciation, and advance the very important conversation on the future of concert music. For undergraduate and graduate students.  Registration is by special permission after an audition and interview.
