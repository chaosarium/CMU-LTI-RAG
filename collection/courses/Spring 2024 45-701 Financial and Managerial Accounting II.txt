Course Description: This course is about developing and using measurement systems to support managerial decision-making and performance evaluation. Because we focus on firmsÂ¿ internal decisions, we are not constrained by the rules and regulations that surround financial accounting. Rather, we work towards developing a conceptual framework that emphasizes the costs and benefits associated with using a particular measurement system. Our goal is to understand how accounting information fits into the dynamics of managing a complex entity.
