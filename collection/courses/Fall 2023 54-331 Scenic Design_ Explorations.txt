Course Description: Students will spend the year in an exciting and intensive exploration of the process of Scene Design as well as an examination of the nature of creativity and storytelling. Students will also engage extensively in the skills a professional Scene Designer requires, such as drafting, drawing, model making, painting and general collaborative skills. Students will be expected to deal with in-depth research, scriptual examinations, careful arrangements of space, composition and groundplan, conceptual structure, real life obstacles and the elements of a successful final project. By the end of this course, students will have improved their overall design skills, have some projects they can include in their portfolio and have created new routes toward their creativity.
