Course Description: Asian American art is not Asian art. Asian art is not Asian American art. The conditions in which we make art in the United States have always been unique: our art has evolved to be antiracist, anti-patriarchal, and for the sake of the undercommons. Expanding oppositional consciousness, the historical context for our exploration and inquiry is enriched by Asian American literature and film; we welcome and renew the lessons of our shared minor feelings. This class also celebrates the Asian American history of collaboration with other BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) communities and the tradition of intersectional artmaking against the hegemonic canon.
