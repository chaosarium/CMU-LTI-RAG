We will examine these challenges with the goal of developing strong normative arguments for corporate policies. Topics covered include: online data collection, media, and marketing; metaverse and virtual reality platforms; autonomous objects; genetic screening and engineering; neural screening and engineering; narrow and general artificial intelligence.
