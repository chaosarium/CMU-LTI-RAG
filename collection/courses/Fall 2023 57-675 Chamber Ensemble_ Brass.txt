<start course description for 57-675 Chamber Ensemble: Brass>
Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: Provides an opportunity for students to play in small ensembles, advised by faculty coaches. The performers will develop effective rehearsal techniques, explore chamber music repertoire, deal with issues of intonation and balance, and arrive at interpretive conclusions that are stylistically sound, yet individualistic and creative.  Low Brass Ensemble: The low brass ensemble pushes the boundaries of what is "supposed" to be played by an ensemble of this type.  Players will be involved in the programming, arranging and planning pf performances and will learn valuable musical, creative, promotional and organizational skills.
