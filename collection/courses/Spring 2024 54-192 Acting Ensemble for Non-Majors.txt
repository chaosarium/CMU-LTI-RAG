Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: This course offers an opportunity to work with undergraduate student directors on their projects, which will widely range in material (e.g. adaptations of literature to television scripts to musical theatre). Directors will hold auditions in the first week of school for their projects, and the actors who are cast will then have the opportunity to enroll in this class. Depending on the project, actors may be cast for one mini or two, potentially working with more than one director.  Actors will be required to attend rehearsals outside of class up to 5 hours a week, and to attend class when showings happen. ******Audition required at the beginning of the semester. Admittance to class by permission of professor. If you are interested, add yourself to the waitlist.*****
