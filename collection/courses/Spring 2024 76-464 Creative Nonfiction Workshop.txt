Course Description: This course will deepen your understanding of the possibilities for writers engaged with the genre of Creative Nonfiction. We'll be reading a range of essays and stories by writers who use their own voice, perceptions, experience, and research to craft work of literary merit that is engaging, sometimes disturbing, sometimes delightful, often challenging our assumptions. Students will write their own essays and memoir, and class will be conducted as a discussion where all will be expected to show up regularly, and remain engaged so as to create a place where students get to know one another and support each other as writers.
