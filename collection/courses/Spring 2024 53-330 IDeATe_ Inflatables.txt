Course Description: In this course, students explore the design, fabrication, and creative applications of sculptural and inflatable forms made from soft materials. Inflatables have a rich history, from early inventions such as hot air balloons and zeppelins, to the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade, to highly inventive architectural structures, to contemporary artworks. Students will learn techniques for turning flexible, flat materials into three-dimensional forms using a variety of methods, including inflating with air, stuffing with materials, and supporting with rigid structures. They will also learn to use a sewing machine, a primary tool for construction. Patterning will be explored extensively, including working from found patterns and designing and creating their own. Students will work at a range of scales, from objects that can be held in the hand to those that can hold the body. They will work both individually and in collaborative teams. Projects will be informed by experimentation, readings, slides, and exploration of context.
