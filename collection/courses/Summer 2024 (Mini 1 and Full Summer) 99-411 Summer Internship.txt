Course Description: This course allows students to engage in paid experiential learning that integrates knowledge and theories from their academic discipline within a relevant professional context. This should include a meaningful project at the internship site where practical application and skills development occurs relevant to the student's major. The internship can be at an internal (CMU) or external site. Students will need to complete a proposal and supervisor agreement form to be eligible. Students are responsible for finding internships and paying for the units of credit. In addition to the time spent at the internship site, students will be expected to write a short paper explaining the application of knowledge and theories as well as skills developed at the internship site as they relate to professional career goals. The course is not eligible for CPT for international students; please contact the Office for International Education for more information. Variable units are decided on a case-by-case basis.  THIS COURSE CANNOT BE TAKEN PASS/NO PASS.  Please contact Dr. Korryn Mozisek, Director of Integrative Learning, Office of the Vice Provost for Education, to discuss your individual internship requirements at: kmozisek@andrew.cmu.edu; Phone: 412-268-3441 or Cathy Ribarchak at cr2@andrew.cmu.edu; 412-268-8677.
