Course Description: How do artists respond to nature and their place in local and global ecologies? Drawing together many histories- walking as an art practice, landscape photography and painting, site-specific installation, earthworks, color and natural dyeing, spiritualism, among others-this course will explore a range of possibilities that inform our own practices as artists. We will consider the ways artists create poetic responses to cultural, ecological, and economic conditions, reflect the tensions between the natural landscape and its transformation, and use their practice to agitate for the protection of biocultural diversity. Framed by our own wanderings, reading, writing, discussion, and presentations, we will deepen our understanding of the relationship between artists and nature.
