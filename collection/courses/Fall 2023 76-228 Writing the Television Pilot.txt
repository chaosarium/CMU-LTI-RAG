Course Description: In this course, students will learn how to write a television pilot the way actual working television writers do, from conception to execution. Every week, the class will watch a different pilot from a famous TV show ¿ ranging anywhere from the Mary Tyler Moore Show to Lost to Breaking Bad. The class will analyze the structure of these pilots to understand what makes them great, and how to shape your own idea into a first episode that can hook an audience for an entire season. Then, students will put what they¿ve learned into practice, coming up with an idea for their own original show and pitching the concept to the class ¿ learning the valuable art of selling your ideas. From there, the class will give and receive feedback on their projects ¿ and then they will practice being in an actual television writer¿s room, brainstorming ideas together to make every project better and getting practice ¿running¿ the writer¿s room as the lead writer on their own concept. When each ¿show¿ has benefited from getting time in the room, the students will write the beginning of their pilot ¿ again, getting feedback from their peers and understanding how to take notes while retaining their authentic voice as a writer and developing a final product they can be proud of. Television is all about working together, and this class will focus on that unique process, giving students experience in how actual television writer¿s rooms are run. And we¿ll watch some great TV along the way!
