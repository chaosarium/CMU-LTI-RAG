Course Description: Good public policy doesn't just "happen."  Rather, successful policy is the result of thorough research, careful drafting, and successful navigation within the government or non-government organization whose leadership may ultimately promulgate it.  The course begins with a brief review of government and organizational behavior in a bureaucracy, and the identification of a federal agency's current policy system as a framework to which we will turn throughout the term.  Study then turns to an overview of legal research skills.  Though usually the province of law students and attorneys, such skills will enable students to know when policy may be crafted "from scratch" -- or where, when, and how policy must conform to larger governing legal or regulatory structures.  Students will then consider a particular sub-specie of public policy, administrative law, which addresses the special circumstance of regulatory agencies and the statutory regimes that create and govern them.  The course culminates with students developing and "staffing" a notional policy, modeled on the federal agency policy system studied throughout the term.  This course may benefit a range of audiences:  students considering government and related policy careers; future business leaders who must set standards for business practices, employee behavior, or operations within the confines of governmental regulations; prospective paralegals and attorneys; or anyone interested in exploring "what the rules are" and why.
