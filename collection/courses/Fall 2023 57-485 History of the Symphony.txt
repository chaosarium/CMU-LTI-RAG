Course Description: This course is a study of major symphonic works from 1750 to the modern period. For reasons we will examine, symphonic literature, and the symphony in particular, has long been considered Western art music's greatest monument to its history. Composers have agonized over its composition, conductors have devoted careers to it, and audiences have deeply and zealously expressed their admiration for it. We want to understand why this music is so revered and long-lasting. And we want to understand how the aesthetics of these works have been shaped by their historical, socio-cultural contexts, and how their meaning and value continue to change. Over the course of the term, we will analyze some of the great examples of this genre. We will place them in their historical, socio-cultural contexts with primary sources and insightful academic scholarship. Your critical listening, reading, and thinking skills will be expanded as we delve into almost three centuries of music and writings.
