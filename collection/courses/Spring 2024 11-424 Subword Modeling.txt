Course Description: The goal of this course is to lead students to engage broadly with the existing NLP and computational linguistics research on subword modeling and develop new computational approaches to problems in morphology, orthography, and phonology. In addition to three other miniprojects, students will be expected to produce one piece of research that can be developed into a conference or workshop paper (though submission is not a course requirement). The paper should be suitable for the ¿Phonology, Morphology, and Word Segmentation¿ tracks of the *ACL conferences, the SIGMORPHON workshop, Coling, or LREC.
