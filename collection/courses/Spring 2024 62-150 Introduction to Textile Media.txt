Course Description: To view the different section topics, visit https://ideate.cmu.edu/courses/portal-and-section-details.html. Technologists, artists, and designers are engaging in new, interdisciplinary modes to consume, create, and reuse media. To do this, they thoughtfully collaborate and critically reflect on media creation, distribution, participation, interaction, and how media affects the audience. In this course, students will challenge themselves to work in these new modal contexts by thinking critically in a genre of exploration. They will formulate the intent of their creative work, articulate relationships to art/design practice and theory, and respond insightfully to creative, media-rich outcomes. The class will introduce core concepts through foundational texts, in-class exercises, collaborative projects, and group critique. Through hands-on media exploration, students will ground concepts such as embodiment, emergence, composition, participatory interfaces, and mediated experiences. Section A will be an Introduction to Textile Media. Section B will be an Introduction to Mediascapes: 2D to 3D Spatial Environments. Section C will be Life in the Digital Factory: Spatial Storytelling about Computational Landscapes.
