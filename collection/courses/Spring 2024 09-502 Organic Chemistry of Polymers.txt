Course Description: A study of the synthesis and reactions of high polymers. Emphasis is on practical polymer preparation and on the fundamental kinetics and mechanisms of polymerization reactions. Topics include: relationship of synthesis and structure, step-growth polymerization, chain-growth polymerization via  radical, ionic and coordination intermediates, copolymerization, discussions of specialty polymers and reactions of polymers. 09-509, Physical Chemistry of Macromolecules, is excellent preparation for this course but is not required. 3-6 hrs. lec. (Graduate Course: 12 units, 09-741)
