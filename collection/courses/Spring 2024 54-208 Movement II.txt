Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: This term is divided between two classic physical forms: Commedia dell'Arte and Clowns. In the first half of the semester students wear the half-masks of the archetypal Commedia characters (Harlequin, Pantalone, et al), to learn their psychology and physicality, improvise on historical and contemporary scenarios, and apply Commedia technique to modern comedy. Commedia dell'Arte gives them the tools to tackle physical comedy from any era, past or present. In the second half of the term students discover their personal Clowns. This clown has nothing to do with the American Barnum & Bailey Circus clown; this is not a character or caricature, but rather a revelation of the clown each student hides under the mask of adulthood. Discovering this clown gives them all a way to laugh at themselves, to uncover what makes each individual uniquely funny; it also lets them see how we only laugh at truth and in the personal material lies universal humor. Inside this freedom is the technique to know what's funny and why, and the ability to apply these rules in comedy."
