Course Description: MSCF Investments gives students a foundation for quantitative portfolio management and for understanding market price determination. Key concepts include risk measurement, risk-reward trade-offs, equilibrium asset pricing, portfolio optimization, benchmarking, price discovery, market efficiency, and pricing anomalies. Specific portfolio management tools include mean-variance optimization, CAPM and APT asset pricing, general equilibrium asset pricing theories and cash-flow/discount-rate decompositions, factor models (e.g., Fama-French), momentum strategies, and performance evaluation. The course presents essential theories and formulas and also reviews important institutional and empirical facts about equity, bond, and commodity markets.  Non-MSCF students may not take this course without written permission from the instructor. To be eligible, you must be a BSCF student or a graduate student enrolled in an MSCF participating college (Dietrich, Heinz, Tepper or Mellon). PhD students with relevant research may be eligible with permission from the instructor.
