Course Description: Attention entrepreneurs, designers, and engineers! This course teaches you to invent digital services. You will learn about value-creation in the service sector and a human-centered design process including brainstorming, story-boarding, interviewing, video sketches, and pitching. Students work in small, interdisciplinary teams to discover unmet needs of users. They conceive of a digital service and assess its technical feasibility, financial viability, and desirability. Then they  produce a plan with a business model and a video sketch and pitch it to industry professionals. Grades will be determined primarily by the quality of the team's products.
