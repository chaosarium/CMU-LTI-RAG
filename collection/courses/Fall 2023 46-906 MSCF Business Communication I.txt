Course Description: The world's top financial organizations want the best communicators. Excellent communicators develop their skills through constant practice and craft. To that end, MSCF offers Business Communication 1. Business Communication 1 focuses on interviewing, networking, and non-verbal language, as well as the cultural influences that affect various business communication. The course immerses students in networking, speaking, writing and interviewing through an interactive experience that includes role play, team exercises, many one-to-one interactions, mock interviews, and peer review. Other MSCF courses requiring written and spoken assignments link to this course. The MSCF Speakers Series is also connected to this course through selected writing/speaking assignments.  Non-MSCF students may not take this course without written permission from the instructor. To be eligible, you must be a BSCF student or a graduate student enrolled in an MSCF participating college (Dietrich, Heinz, Tepper or Mellon). PhD students with relevant research may be eligible with permission from the instructor.
