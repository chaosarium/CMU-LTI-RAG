Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: What role should the United States play in the world? Should the U.S. solely protect its own borders or advance democracy, promote human rights, and contain aggressive countries?  These are questions that Americans have wrestled with throughout modern U.S. history. In this class, students will learn about those arguments and engage in debate over both the goals of U.S. foreign policy and the means of achieving them. This course will situate current events in the historical context of grand strategy during and after the Cold War, as well as a wider understanding of how countries determine their goals and seek to pursue them through a combination of diplomatic, economic, military, and political means. Students will explore the connection between domestic and foreign affairs and how all these issues relate to current U.S. strategy toward a rising China, an assertive Russia, and so-called "rogue states" like Iran and North Korea. Students should emerge from the class with a better understanding of U.S. grand strategy but also with a greater ability to formulate and communicate their own views on U.S. strategy toward the rest of the world.
