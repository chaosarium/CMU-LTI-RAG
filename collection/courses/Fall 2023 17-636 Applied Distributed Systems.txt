Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: Modern computing systems are frequently hosted on the cloud. That is, they are inherently distributed systems. To appropriately build and deploy these systems developers should know not only about development tools such as container management tools but also the structure of the cloud - in particular how it utilizes virtual machines, containers and networks. They should also understand security mechanisms both in the internet and how to authorize users and maintain credentials securely. Finally, to protect the system once it is placed into production, a developer needs to know how to enable the detection of problems during execution through collection and navigation of logs produced by the system. These are the topics covered by this course.
