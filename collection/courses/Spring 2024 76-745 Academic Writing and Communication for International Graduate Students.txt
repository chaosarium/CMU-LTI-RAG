Course Description: This course is designed to help multilingual or international graduate students strengthen their written and oral communication skills in English as they engage in communication tasks frequently found in U.S. academic and scholarly contexts.  Topics include genre and rhetorical analysis, ethical source use, oral presentation and visual design, as well as textual structure, style, clarity, and coherence. Students will analyze conventional academic texts to familiarize themselves with features and strategies employed by communicators.  This practice will enable higher comprehension while increasing confidence in their communication abilities in academic English. Class sessions will involve research-based and corpus-driven discussion and activities to support both productive and receptive language skills.  Students will transfer skills gained in genre awareness and knowledge to other academic and professional situations.
