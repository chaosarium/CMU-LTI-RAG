Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: This course provides an overview of the mechanical principles underlying human movement biomechanics and the experimental and modeling techniques used to study it. Specific topics will include locomotion, motion capture systems, force plates, muscle mechanics, musculoskeletal modeling, three dimensional kinematics, inverse dynamics, forward dynamic simulations, and imaging-based biomechanics. Homework and final class projects will emphasize applications of movement biomechanics in orthopedics, rehabilitation, and sports.  ***Students are expected to have knowledge of ordinary differential equations and rigid body dynamics at the level of 24-351.***
