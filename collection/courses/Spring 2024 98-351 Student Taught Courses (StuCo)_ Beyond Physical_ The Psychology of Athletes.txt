Course Description: Sports and athletes are domains that resonate with many of us, either personally or through people we know. It is estimated that billions of people worldwide identify as athletes. Often, we perceive these individuals as high-performing humans, yet few truly understand the aspect of their mental processes. In this course, me and you will go on a journey to explore the inner workings of athletes' minds, seeking to understand their thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. The course structure is designed to ensure a comprehensive understanding of athlete psychology. Approximately 70% of our time will be dedicated to instructional content, providing insights into athletes' behaviors across various sportsÂ¿be it team-based or individual. The remaining 30% will be a discussion and an interaction with athletes from the specific sports, allowing them to share their personal experiences and insights. Join me as we go deep into sport psychology, relating physical and mental resilience.
