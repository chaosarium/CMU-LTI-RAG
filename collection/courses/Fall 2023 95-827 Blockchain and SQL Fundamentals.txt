Course Description: This is a medley class that combines SQL (accessing and processing data stored in large, centralized data stores) and blockchain smart contracts (accessing and processing data stored in decentralized ledgers). There is significant interest in the industry for both approaches. The course is designed to provide the student with a serious and hands-on introduction to SQL and smart contract programming. Applications will primarily be chosen from the area of computational finance. Students should come to the class with knowledge of at least one programming language.  Students who have already taken:  a database management course that covered SQL, or 95-788 Developing Blockchain Use Cases, should not register for this course.
