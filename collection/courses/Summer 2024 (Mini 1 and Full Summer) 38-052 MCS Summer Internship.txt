Course Description: The Mellon College of Science at Carnegie Mellon considers experiential learning opportunities important educational options for its undergraduate students. One such option is an internship, normally completed during the summer. Students do not need to officially register for an internship unless they want it listed on their official transcripts. The MCS Undergraduate Dean's Office will add the course to the student's schedule, and the student will be assessed tuition for 3 units. Upon completion of the internship, students must submit a 1-2 page report of their work experience, and a 1-2 page evaluation from the academic or company supervisor to the Undergraduate Dean's Office in DH 1324. After the reports have been reviewed and approved, a "P" grade will be assigned.
