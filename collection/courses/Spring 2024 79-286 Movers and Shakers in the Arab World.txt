Course Description: Through an exploration of the legacy and contributions of key Arab figures from the 19 th century (Arab Renaissance: "Nahda") to the present day, this course aims to provide students with a historical overview and understanding of key issues that continue to engage Arab thought. We will explore how these key Arab figures impacted narratives, reshaped issues, and effected political, social, economic, and cultural change that continues to this day. The course will focus on figures from different domains, including thinkers, writers, poets, politicians, and artists, and we will study how these figures embodied hopes and aspirations (or not), and advanced their causes. The course will involve relevant written and audiovisual materials from different media sources and literary texts (as appropriate).
