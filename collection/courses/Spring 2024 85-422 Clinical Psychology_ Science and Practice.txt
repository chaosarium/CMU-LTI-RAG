Course Description: In this course, students will be exposed to the science and practice of clinical psychology, with a particular emphasis on the synergistic relationship between clinical psychological research and clinical practice. We will focus on the four major activities that clinical psychologists engage in (research, assessment, diagnosis, and psychotherapy). Students will learn about the clinical characteristics of major psychological disorders and the empirically-validated treatments available for these conditions. We will make frequent use of research findings and the scientific method to evaluate and understand concepts in clinical psychology. Critical thinking will be emphasized as we explore the scientific strengths and limitations of various treatments for psychological disorders. This course is designed to be a smaller seminar course for juniors and seniors considering graduate school in clinical psychology.
