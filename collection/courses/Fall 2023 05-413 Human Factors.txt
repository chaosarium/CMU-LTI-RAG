Course Description: This course uses theory and research from human factors, cognitive science,  and social science to understand and design the interactions of humans with  the built world, tools, and technology.  The course emphasizes current work  in applied domains such as automotive design, house construction, medical  human factors, and design of information devices.  The course also will  emphasize not only individual human factors (e.g., visual response,  anthropometry) but also the organizational arrangements that can amplify  or correct human factors problems.    Through reading, discussion, and projects, you will learn about human  perceptual, cognitive, and physical processes that affect how people  interact with, and use, technology and tools.  You will learn why we have  so many automobile accidents, voting irregularities, and injuries from  prescription medication. You will learn some tried and true solutions for  human factors problems, and some of the many problems in human factors that  remain. You will also have gained experience in research in this field.
