Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: Using the basic skills learned in the first semester,  we will develop better and explore the use of basic drafting processes to solve more complex problems.  The conventions of drafting do not change with the different types of drawings so  line weight, clarity, neatness and organization will continue to be emphasized.  We will also begin to discuss ways to improve the cosmetics of  draftings.  As before, classes will consist mostly of lecture and demonstration.  Some class sessions will be dedicated to working on assigned projects, generally one class meeting per project.
