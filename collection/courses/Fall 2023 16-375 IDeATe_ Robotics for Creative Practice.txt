Course Description: Robots come in all shapes and sizes: it is the integration of software and hardware that can make any machine surprisingly animate.  This  project-oriented course brings art and engineering together to build performance systems using embodied behavior as a creative medium.  Students learn skills for designing, constructing and programming automated systems for storytelling and human interaction, then explore  the results through exhibition and performance.  Technical topics include closed-loop motion control, expressive physical and  computational behavior, machine choreography, and performance conceptualization.  Discussion topics include both contemporary kinetic  sculpture and robotics research.  This interdisciplinary course is part of IDeATe Physical Computing but is open to any student.
