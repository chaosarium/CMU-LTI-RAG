Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: This course considers key issues and trade-off in R&D; strategy and organization, paying attention to dynamic competitive contexts where technology plays a key role. These topics are treated assuming the perspective of the decision maker. It addresses typical problems of large, medium and small firms having a structured R&D; and operating businesses where R&D; is the source of competitive advantages. Although we will heavily focus on R&D;, emphasis is placed on viewing R&D; as a part (although, a key part) of the process of technological innovation; therefore, as an activity to be strongly and appropriately integrated with other functions to make innovation successful.
