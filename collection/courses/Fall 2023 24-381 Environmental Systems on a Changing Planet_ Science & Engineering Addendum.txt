Course Description: This 3-unit course is an add-on to the co-requisite course 24-291, Environmental Systems on a Changing Planet. While 24-291 is designed to be accessible to students from all Colleges and major, this add-on course 24-381 allows students to engage with the material with more technical depth and quantitative understanding. 24-381 is intended for students from STEM majors in the colleges of Computer Science, Engineering, and Science, but can be taken by any student that is interested in exploring the environmental science topics with greater depth. Science and engineering fundamentals will be further developed and applied to deepen the quantitative understanding of the function and feedbacks of complex environmental systems.  24-381 along with 24-291 introduce the interconnected Earth systems that regulate our climate and ecosystems, providing the resources required to sustain all life, including human societies. Please refer to the course description for 24-291 for more information. This course draws on principles learned in introductory science and engineering courses at CMU and serves as the foundational Earth & Environmental Science requirement for both the interdisciplinary Minor and Additional Major in Environmental and Sustainability Studies. 24-381 highly recommended for students enrolled in the College of Engineering, Mellon College of Science, and School of Computer Science. When taken with 24-291, 24-381 will count as a technical elective for most programs in these STEM colleges, while 24-291 on its own is not considered a technical elective for STEM programs.
