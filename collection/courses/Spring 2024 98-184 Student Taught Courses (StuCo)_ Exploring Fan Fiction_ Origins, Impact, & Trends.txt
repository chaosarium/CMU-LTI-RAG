Course Description: Fanfiction is a literary medium where individuals can expand upon a pre-existing media, whether by creating alternate universes, alternate endings, or new characters. In this course we will learn about the history of fanfiction, the trends throughout these pieces of work, and the impact fanfiction has both inside and outside of a fandom. Each class will focus on a new topic relating to these and will have open discussions on the theme. This course is open to anyone willing to learn, whether they are fanfiction readers, writers, or just curious souls.
