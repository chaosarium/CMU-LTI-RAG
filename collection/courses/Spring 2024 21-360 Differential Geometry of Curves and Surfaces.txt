Course Description: The course is a rigorous introduction to the differential and integral calculus of curves and surfaces. Topics to be covered include: Parameterized and regular curves Frenet equations canonical coordinate system, local canonical forms, global properties of plane curves Regular surfaces, differential functions on surfaces, the tangent plane and differential of a map, orientation of surfaces, characterization of compact orientable surfaces, classification of compact surfaces The geometry of the Gauss map, isometries and conformal maps, parallel transport, geodesics, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem and applications. More topics may be covered, as time allows. Students should be prepared to write proofs and perform computations. 21-356 or 21-236 are recommended. (Three 50 minute lectures)
