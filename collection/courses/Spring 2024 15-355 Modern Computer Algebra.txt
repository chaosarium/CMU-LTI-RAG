Course Description: The goal of this course is to investigate the relationship between algebra  and computation. The course is designed to expose students to algorithms  used for symbolic computation, as well as to the concepts from modern  algebra which are applied to the development of these algorithms. This  course provides a hands-on introduction to many of the most important ideas  used in symbolic mathematical computation, which involves solving system of  polynomial equations (via Groebner bases), analytic integration, and solving  linear difference equations. Throughout the course the computer algebra system Mathematica will be used for computation.
