Course Description: This course might be described as "Communications and Networking in the field". Building upon an understanding of networking fundamentals, this course studies advanced concepts of telecommunications networks. This course explores the design and implementation of the network architecture and management services that compose modern and emerging network infrastructure. Topics include network configurations (DHCP, NAT, IPv6, routing, and forwarding), network emulation and simulation, network modeling and measurements, virtual networks, data center networks, wireless communications (including satellite, modern wireless at small- and -large scale, mesh, etc.), Software-Defined Networks, Network Function Virtualization, etc.  In successfully completing this course, students will have the opportunity to design, deploy, and configure network devices in real-world (simulated) scenarios. In addition, students will have the opportunity to develop and code custom network applications to better analyze network protocols.
