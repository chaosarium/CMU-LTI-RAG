Course Description: Intermediate Japanese II is the second part of a two-semester course sequence (82-271, 82-272) and continues the shift in instructional focus, which started in Intermediate Japanese I, from learning to use Japanese in a culturally appropriate manner to using Japanese to learn Japanese culture. With a dual focus on developing communication skills and cultural analysis skills, the course takes an integrated approach in designing meaningful, goal-oriented learning activities so that students can practice communication skills and cultural analysis skills simultaneously. In pairs and small groups, students will discuss various cultural topics of current relevance for Japan by drawing on authentic materials (e.g., newspaper articles, comic strips, TV commercials, films) as well as learner materials in the textbook and the course packet and by comparing Japanese culture and their own in regard to those topics. As part of the course work, students will also enjoy an opportunity to have a small group discussion on the topics of their term projects with Japanese residents in Pittsburgh as well as a one-on-one discussion on the same topics with a speaking assistant.
