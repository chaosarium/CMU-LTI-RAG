Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: Why do modern societies go to great lengths to protect some animals and slaughter others? Why do some cultures make pets of animals that other cultures turn into a meal? What are the environmental ramifications of hunting, domestication, and trading animals? Is there a connection between human pandemics like COVID-19 and animals? Why are there so many cute animals inhabiting social media? These are some of the questions that we will seek to answer as we trace changes in human--animal relationships over time. We will explore these themes through both texts and visual representations (art, film, photography) of animals. Evaluation will be based on active participation in class discussions, submission of weekly field notes, and a final curated exhibit of images of people and animals.
