Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: Global Studies Guided Reading (Fall 2023: The Environment and Climate Change)  The main goal of this seminar is to encourage students to engage deeply with four books on a distinct topic, and discuss them under the guidance of the professor. You could think of this seminar as a more academically-oriented monthly book club!   The small size of the seminar allows for a deep immersion in the readings, and for the development of critical thinking among students. The four books are selected by the professor, and the selection is based on several criteria, including the books' impact, current relevance, regional foci, as well as diversity and inclusivity reflected by the authors' different social, racial, and geographical backgrounds.   The topics of the seminars each semester will vary, but all will have global relevance. (For instance, the Fall '22 seminar will focus on the environment and climate change, and the Spring '23 seminar will deal with the topic of cultural and historical memory).   Important: In order to encourage all of the students' constant participation and their deep engagement with the books, as well as foster a sense of intellectual community, this seminar will be strategically small. For these reasons, only the GS majors will be allowed to register for this monthly guided reading. Meets monthly on Fridays.
