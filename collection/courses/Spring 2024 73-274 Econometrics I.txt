Course Description: Data tools are important in guiding decisions and strategies for individuals, businesses, and policymakers. This course will prepare you for data-driven decision making, providing both theoretical backgrounds and empirical illustrations of the techniques that are necessary to cope with real-world (imperfect) data. Specifically, the course covers tools and methods for estimating economic relationships, testing economic theories, and evaluating business and government policy. This course builds on either of the two Statistical Reasoning courses (36-200/201) and the Economics and Data Science course (73-265), and it sets underpinnings for Econometrics II (73-275) for more advanced tools and insights for business and economics data analyses. Students pursuing the ECOMTH or MTHECO degrees may enroll in 73-274 after the completion of 36-225. Minimum grade of "C" required in all economics and statistics pre-requisite courses.
