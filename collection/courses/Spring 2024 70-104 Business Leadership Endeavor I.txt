Course Description: Business Leadership Endeavor (BLE) is a required 3-mini course sequence (70-104,70-204,70-304) offered to undergraduate business students only. BLE 70-104 is the first mini of the BLE course sequence.  Each previous mini will serve as a pre-requisite for the next in sequence. BLE introduces students to their leadership journey via four development frameworks: student development, personal development, professional development, and community development. BLE 70-104 will introduce students to the fundamental building blocks required for their development. Students will learn to develop and improve habits, sharpen personal and professional development skills, and develop meaningful networks. This course may use third-party course material that is not available for individual purchase from the publisher.   If so, the third-party course material will be secured and provided by the Tepper School to students enrolled in the course, and students enrolled in the course will be required to pay to the University the associated additional course materials fee for the third-party course material provided.   The amount of the course materials fee is dependent on the University's cost of the particular materials provided, and typically ranges from $13 to $75.
