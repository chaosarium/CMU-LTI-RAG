Course Description: This course will introduce students to the process of designing, laying out, and ordering a printed circuit board from a commercial vendor using commercial layout tools. Boards will be laid out to accommodate circuit schematics provided to the students (with possible modifications made by students). Students will order circuit components and populate the fabricated board when it is returned from the vendor. The final stage of the course will involve testing the completed board for functionality.
