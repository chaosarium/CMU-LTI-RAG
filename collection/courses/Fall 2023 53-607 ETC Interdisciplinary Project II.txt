Course Description: The central part of the ETC curriculum is the project course. In this course, students are in small, interdisciplinary teams, creating artifacts under direct faculty supervision. An artifact may be a web site, a piece of software, a piece of hardware, a design document, or a number of other things. Artifacts are typically intended to be prototypes, not production models. Each project team, working with their faculty member, must design what they are going to create, the mechanisms by which they will create it, and then actually create it.
