Course Description: The course will cover advanced techniques for modeling, texturing, and rendering realistic digital props for use in visual effects and 3D animation. Students will create a series of high-quality models in Maya, texture them with Substance 3D Painter, and then render them in Maya's Arnold renderer. The class will cover project organization, hard-surface modeling techniques, highly-detailed texturing workflows, color space management, look development, and some lighting. At the end of the course, students will composite their 3D assets seamlessly into a photo as well as render turntables to present their work.
