Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: In this class, we will learn sign language to the rhythm of well-known music! Each class will cover a different topic, starting at fingerspelling and basic conversation and moving to signs for school and family topics. The history of sign language and deaf culture will be explored as well. Each week the assignment will be to learn the signs for the chorus of a song that uses words learned in class. The final project is to create a sign language music video. Each weekly session will be 80 minutes. The class will begin with a Pop Quiz/Review of prior vocabulary. Following that, we will learn the new vocabulary for about 30 minutes. Then, we will learn the assignment for the week, explore deaf history and culture, and play games in the remaining time.
