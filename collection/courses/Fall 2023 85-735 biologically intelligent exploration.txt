Course Description: Humans and other mammals exhibit a high degree of control when selecting actions in noisy contexts, quickly adapting to unexpected outcomes in order to better exploit opportunities arising in the future. This course will explore both the cognitive and neurobiological systems of adaptive decision-making, through a mixture of readings, lectures, and hands-on modeling projects (in Python and Matlab).
