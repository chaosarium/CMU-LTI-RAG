Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: This course focuses on the practical implementation of feedback / feedforward controllers.  The entire controller design process is presented, including system modeling and identification, compensator design, simulation, and hardware prototyping.  This is a project-based course in which students complete the controller design process on a nonlinear, MIMO hardware system.  The goal is train students on the system integration skills necessary for success in industry or experimental laboratory work.
