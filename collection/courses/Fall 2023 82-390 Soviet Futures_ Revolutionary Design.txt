Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: This course explores the history of Soviet design from aspirations of an everyday Utopia following the 1917 Revolution to the crumbling facades and "post-Communist aesthetic" of the former USSR today. Students will learn about alternative visions of everyday life and the future from the designers, artists, and theorists themselves, engaging with visual works, historical documents, and manifestos. Class time will also be dedicated to the design theory and philosophy of other 20th century Socialist states such as Yugoslavia and the People's Republic of China.
