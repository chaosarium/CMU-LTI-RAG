Course Description: As the final course in a sequence of studio courses for Communication Design majors, this one builds on everything learned previously. Apply skills/knowledge learned in researching, developing, evaluating, refining communications to multi-facetted communication challenges that warrant the design of multiple communication pieces that span diverse mediums (in print and digital platforms) and function as a system; learn how to design for futuring (parts of the system yet to be determined) and for co-design where parts of the system are made for growth through contributions from audiences. This course is required of Communication Design majors in the School of Design.
