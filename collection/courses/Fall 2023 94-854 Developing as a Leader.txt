Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: This course introduces students to leadership via three learning frameworks: models, practice and reflection. Using guest lectures, readings and videos, and small group discussions, the faculty will work with the students to define leadership and provide applicable frameworks for their leadership practice. Students will be able to experiment and practice different skills and styles in a safe environment where they can receive useful feedback. To help students pursue their own personal path of leadership development, our focus is on formulating personal goals, models and activities that sustain this development over the course of their careers.  Learning Objectives:  Learn tools for effective reflection and self-awareness  Determine your leadership values and your leadership plan of action  Listen to, respect and heed the advice and ideas of others
