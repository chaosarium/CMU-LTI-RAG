Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: Scandal, conspiracy, and partisan propaganda have been among the stuff of media ever since newspapers first appeared in America, and now they figure prominently in electronic media as well. The question "What is truth" is not just a matter of philosophical speculation, but a critical issue in contemporary life, from elections to pandemics to climate change and war. Officials at the highest levels make dubious claims, and find media outlets to support them - all driven by motivations other than a commitment to truth. This course is literally "ripped from the headlines" examining conflicts over credibility in print and online in the context of historical experience. We'll explore ways of determining when news really is "fake" and when it's more likely to be "an inconvenient truth."
