Course Description: Mathematical techniques are presented as tools for modeling and solving engineering problems. Modeling of steady-state mass and energy balance problems using linear and matrix algebra, including Gaussian elimination, decomposition, and iterative techniques. Modeling of unsteady-state engineering problems using linear and nonlinear differential equations. Analytical techniques, including Laplace transforms, and numerical techniques for the solution of first-and higher-order differential equations and systems of differential equations arising in engineering models. Finally, the modeling of processes affected by chance and subject to experimental error; statistical and regression techniques within the context of experimental design and analysis of experimental data.
