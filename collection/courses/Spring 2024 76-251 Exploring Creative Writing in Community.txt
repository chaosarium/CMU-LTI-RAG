Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: This course, taught in Somerset Prison, will be focused on the ways generative writing can deepen empathy for self and others, while expanding imagination. We will read stories, poems, novels, and creative non-fiction for inspiration, and students will create their own work often using the readings as models. In class, prompts will be offered for more writing, and students will share their work. The class is based on understanding that Creative Writing has the power to re-shape how we see our past, present, and future. Just as importantly, through creative work we can re-shape our ideas about ourselvesÂ¿who we are, and who we are becoming, in the world. A good class for those interested in the intersection between justice and education. Half of the class will be composed of incarcerated people, and the other half will be Carnegie Mellon students. All Carnegie Mellon students with interest in writing are welcome. Please fill out the form in the course URL.
