Course Description: In this course students will read and discuss the poems and collections of contemporary poets, attend outside readings and events, critique their classmates' poems, and create a body of poetic work. We will look closely at such things as lineation and form, hybrid and multimedia poetics, and the role of poetry in a charged political and pandemic landscape. I will encourage students to experiment and to take their craft in new directions through weekly writing assignments and in-class exercises. Ultimately, this course will help students become stronger writers, readers, and critics.
