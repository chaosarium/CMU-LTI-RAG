<start course description for 33-451 Senior Research>
Semester: Fall 2023 (aka F23)
Course Description: Open to all senior physics majors. May include research done in a research lab, extending the capabilities of a teaching lab, or a theoretical or computational physics project for 3 to 9 units of credit. The student experiences the less structured atmosphere of a research program where there is much room for independent initiative. Modern Physics Laboratory, 33-340, should precede this course, though it is not required. Student should contact faculty directly to inquire about opportunities.
