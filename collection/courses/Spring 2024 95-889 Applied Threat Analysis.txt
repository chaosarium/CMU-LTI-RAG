Course Description: The role of Cyber Threat Analysts is to aggregate and fuse disparate data sources to provide actionable information to decision makers in industry as well as both the federal and civilian government. More and more these sectors are relying on analysts who have a deep understanding of the ecosystem and the risks contained therein to better understand the cyber threats that they are facing. This course seeks to provide a richer context and a basis for understanding the evolving nature of cyber threats. This class will discuss the relationship between vulnerabilities, exploits, and malware. In addition this class will also explore the value of host based or network indicators and other indicators of compromise. Finally we will discuss the continuum of threat actors and why sometimes the greatest threat is from within.
