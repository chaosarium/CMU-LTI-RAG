<start course description for 33-451 Senior Research>
Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: Open to all senior physics majors. May include research done in a research lab, extending the capabilities of a teaching lab, or a theoretical or computational physics project for 3 to 9 units of credit. The student experiences the less structured atmosphere of a research program where there is much room for independent initiative. Modern Physics Laboratory, 33-340, should precede this course, though it is not required. Student should contact faculty directly to inquire about opportunities. Registration requires approval of the Director of Undergraduate Affairs.  Students are required to present their work at the annual Undergraduate Research Symposium in April.
