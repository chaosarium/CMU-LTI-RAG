Course Description: Drawing inspiration from Strunk and Whites seminal work The Elements of Style, the course The Elements of Professional Practice covers basic guidance and examples for communicating professionally with sponsors, in teams, and about your independent work and progresses to more complicated challenges like teaming, fluid groupings, and conflict resolution. We will use readings, case studies, activities, scenarios, assessments etc., to discuss these and more, especially issues that may arise with ambiguity, shared control, constructive criticism and engagement. One of the main goals is for you to begin/continue forming an authentic, effective professional voice in your business communications as you move into a new phase of your professional life after graduation.
