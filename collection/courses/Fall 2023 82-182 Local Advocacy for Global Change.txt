Course Description: When countries committed to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, they specifically recognized the critical role of local authorities. But how can these local actors engage in global policy discussions, taking into account different cultures and contexts? In this course, students will select a set of local issues, determine how they relate to the Sustainable Development Goals, and identify the relevant international frameworks for taking action. At the end of the course, each student will have developed a brief advocacy plan for linking their local priorities to international objectives.
