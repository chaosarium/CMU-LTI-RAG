Course Description: The Jewish Healthcare Foundation strives to make aging a joyful experience. With this vision in mind, a team of students will aim to conduct a market analysis in order to provide a report and presentation to the Foundation on areas such as policy, technology and/or infrastructure that counter aging mobility as a limiting factor. This exercise may cover a review of what exists in the aging space globally and/or specifically in the Pittsburgh community. Of note, in this project mobility may be defined broadly including areas such as transportation, physical limitations, use of technology etc.
