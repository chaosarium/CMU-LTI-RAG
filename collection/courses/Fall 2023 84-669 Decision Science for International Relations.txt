Course Description: Decision Science looks at choices from three interrelated perspectives: analysis, characterizing decision makers' options, in terms of expected effects on outcomes that they value; description, characterizing decision makers' beliefs and preferences; and interventions, helping decision makers to choose among the options available to them or create better ones.  The first half of the course will introduce foundational research in Decision Science.  The second half will apply that research to issues in international relations and politics.
