Course Description: Let's face it: there are too many videogames in this world. Luckily, game engines and game design principles can be used for a variety of purposes! This installment of Experimental Game Studio focuses on artful software, interactables, nongames, digital toys, procedural generators, educational applications, and other playthings. The course is divided in two parts: in the first half of the semester students will be asked to create three prototypes starting from an open-ended prompt. In the second half, the most promising prototypes will be iterated, playtested, and polished into complete projects. Students will work in teams. Some programming experience is recommended.
