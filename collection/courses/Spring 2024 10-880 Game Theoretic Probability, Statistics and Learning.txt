Course Description: We will study the game-theoretic foundation for probability, statistics and learning, and its applications to prediction, testing, estimation and change detection. It will distinctively employ modern concepts around betting, e-values, and martingales, effectively bridging Bayesian, frequentist and model-free or adversarial perspectives on these topics.
