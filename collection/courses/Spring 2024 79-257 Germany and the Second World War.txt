<start course description for 79-257 Germany and the Second World War>
Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: This course, taught in Somerset prison, covers many aspects of the war unleashed by the Third Reich: its origins; Hitler's ideology and war plans; the course of the war; major military operations; the Holocaust; Nazi occupation of Europe; resistance to Nazism; and life inside Germany. It concentrates on the Wehrmacht's strategies, decisions, and its relationship with Hitler and Nazi organizations. (The Wehrmacht was the Third Reich's "defense/armed forces" but the term is generally used to refer to its army.) We will investigate the role of the Wehrmacht in Nazi/SS crimes against humanity, including genocide, fighting partisans, killing civilians, and the treatment of Soviet POWs. We aim to understand how, where, why, and when the Wehrmacht came to have "dirty hands." Course readings; chapters from Ben H. Shepherd, Hitler's Soldiers: The German Army in the Third Reich; chapters from Nicholas Stargardt, The German War: A Nation under Arms, 1939-1945; primary documents. Written assignments (10 in total): weekly 500-600 word responses to questions based on course readings. The course combines lecture, discussion, in-class group exercises, and a debate.
