Course Description: The Advanced Game Studio is a semester long video game development project.  The objective is to provide students with an opportunity to design and deliver a more fully realized and refined game, and with practical working experience with teammates from different backgrounds and disciplines.   Students will be divided into teams based upon interest and ability, and will take a game through all steps of development from initial concept to final product.  A number of platforms will be available for use, including virtual and augmented reality systems. Section B Introduction Dark Ride Design is intended to give Location Based Entertainment (LBE) students knowledge and experience within the realm of designing a dark ride experience.
