Semester: Spring 2024 (aka S24)
Course Description: Railroads in the USA are often considered as a subject for nostalgia or public sector failure, an image largely based on passenger service. However, the USA's private sector freight rail industry is considered a model for the world as the result of its renaissance following deregulation in 1980. This is a "stealth" industry whose history and economics are both intertwined and complex.  Students will gain a basic understanding of the industry's history and economics and its role in the national transportation network, with special attention to the past half-century. In addition, students will participate in small group research projects in particular areas of special interest - for example, economic history, industry and safety culture, network economics, utility regulation or transportation policy.
