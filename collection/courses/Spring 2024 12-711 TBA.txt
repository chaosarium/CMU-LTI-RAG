Course Description: The intent of this course is to introduce students to the concepts associated with information modeling and analysis.  The students learn the fundamentals of object-oriented modeling, the building information modeling (BIM) efforts and standards in the Architecture/ Engineering/Construction and Facility Management (A/E/C/FM) industry.  At the same time, the students are exposed to and gain hands-on experiences with some of the existing software systems in the A/E/C/FM industry that leverage such information models for decision support.
