Course Description: This course is an introduction to the process of filmmaking. You will develop a personal cinematic language and create a short final film from the synopsis to the set then to the editing room. The focus will be on understanding the various aspects of the cinematic language, emphasizing the basic visual components - using space, tone, line, shape, color, movement, and rhythm - and how they are used to tell the story visually. These components define characters and communicate moods, emotions, thoughts, and ideas. Audio layering to create a diegetic space and the art of Editing will be discussed extensively. This class will explore the audio and visual forms that can be created to serve the content developed in a synopsis through film screenings, filming assignments, and peer reviews.
