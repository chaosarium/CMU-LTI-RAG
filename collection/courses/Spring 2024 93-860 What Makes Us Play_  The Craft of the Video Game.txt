Course Description: This course delves deep into the art of creating and shipping video games. We will take students on a journey from an examination of the fundamental principles of game design and the realities of shipping discrete gaming products into the dynamic online marketplace. From there, we'll dive into the broader, harder to define side of the industry - how social gaming manifests in today's market, and what it means to take a game across gaming platforms.  Through lectures, discussion, and practical exercises, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of the craft of gaming. Students will be expected to approach the material with an open mind and spend some time exploring games hands-on outside of class.
