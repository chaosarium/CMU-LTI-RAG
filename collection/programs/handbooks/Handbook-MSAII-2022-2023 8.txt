9.1 Working Space for MS Students 
Except for restrictions due to COVID, full-time students in the LTI’s MS degree programs on the 
Pittsburgh campus have access to a shared working space to create a sense of community and 
provide space for working when on campus. 
9.2 Photocopies and Printers 
Mailboxes, printers, copiers, and other departmental resources are located in GHC 5404 
The use of a photocopier requires only a CMU ID card.  The School of Computer Science 
provides a number of black-and-white and color printers for use by students.  The SCS 
Computer Facilities publishes a list of printers online at https://computing.cs.cmu.edu/desktop/printing.  When you send a file to  the print queue, you 
may go to any of the listed printers, swipe yo ur CMU ID, and the file will be printed on that 
printer. 
9.3 Computers for MS Students 
Students are expected to provide their own laptop computers that can be used to access 
university resources and complete course assignments.  Laptops running  Windows, MacOS, and 
Linux software are all acceptable. 
MS students will be given a CS user id.  A CS us er id is required to use the LTI computer cluster, 
department printers, and other SC S services.  The School of Computer Science has a Help 
Center located at 4203 GHC.  They can be contacted at help@cs.cmu.edu , extension 8-4231 from 
a campus phone, or 412-268-4 231 from an outside line. 
MS students will be given access to the LTI’s computer cluster on an as-needed basis, to be used 
for course assignments, directed study projects, and/or the capstone project.  The LTI cluster 
provides storage and computation for projects  involving large datasets and/or lengthy 
computation.
