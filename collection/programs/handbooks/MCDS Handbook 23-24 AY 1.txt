2.1 Main Office 
The Gates Hillman Complex: Mailboxes, printers, copiers, and other departmental 
resources are in GHC 5404. 
2.2 Photocopies and Printers 
The use of a printer/copier requires a CS user id (see the ‘Computers’ section). The School 
of Computer Science provides several black-and-white and color printers for use by 
students. SCS Computing Facilities maintains a list of printers:  
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~help/printing/.  
2.3 Office Space for MS Students 
Full-time students in the LTI’s MS degree programs on the Pittsburgh campus have 
access to a shared working space to create a sense of community and provide space for 
working when on campus. 
2.4 Computers for MS Students 
Students are expected to provide their own laptop computers that can be used to access 
university resources and complete course assignments. Laptops running Windows, 
MacOS, and Linux software are all acceptable. 
 
MS students will be given a CS user id. A CS user id is required to use the LTI computer 
cluster, department printers, and other SCS services. The School of Computer Science 
has a Help Center located at 4203 GHC. They can be contacted at help@cs.cmu.edu , 
extension 8-4231 from a campus phone, or 412-268-4231 from an outside line. 
 
MS students will be given access to the LTI’s computer cluster on an as-needed basis, to 
be used for course assignments, directed study projects, and/or the capstone project. The 
LTI cluster provides storage and computation for projects involving large datasets and/or 
lengthy computation.
