2 Mission, Vision and Philosophy 
Carnegie Mellon University will have a transformative impact on society through continual 
innovation in education, research, creativity, and entrepreneurship. 
Our mission is to create a transformative educational experience for students focused on deep 
disciplinary knowledge; problem solving; teamwork, leadership, communication, and 
interpersonal skills; and personal health and well-being. 
The university community is committed to (a) attracting and retaining diverse, world-class 
talent; (b) creating a collaborative environment open to the free exchange of ideas, in which 
research, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship can flourish; and (c) ensuring individuals 
can achieve their full potential. 
We encourage our members to impact society in  a transformative way — regionally, nationally, 
and globally — by engaging with partners out side the traditional borders of the university 
campus.  See the full university mission statement.
