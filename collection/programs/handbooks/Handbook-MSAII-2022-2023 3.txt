4 Carnegie Mellon Code 
Students at Carnegie Mellon, because they are members of an academic community dedicated to 
the achievement of excellence, are expected to meet the highest standards of personal, ethical 
and moral conduct possible. 
These standards require personal  integrity, a commitment to honesty without compromise, as 
well as truth without equivocation and a willingness to place the good of the community above 
the good of the self. Obligations once undertaken must be me t, commitments kept. 
As members of the Carnegie Mellon community , individuals are expected to uphold the 
standards of the community in addition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is 
rare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply. 
The discovery, advancement, and communication of knowledge are not possible without a 
commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the 
creativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit  for prior knowledge. 
Without the ability to trust that these principles will be observed, an academic community 
cannot exist. 
The commitment of its faculty, staff, and students to these standards contributes to the high 
respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. Students must not destroy that respect by 
their failure to meet these standards. Stud ents who cannot meet them should voluntarily 
withdraw from the university.
