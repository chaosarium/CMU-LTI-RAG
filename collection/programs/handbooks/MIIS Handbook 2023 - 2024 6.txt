http://www.cmu.edu/education- office/disability -resources/  
The Office of Disability Resources at Carnegie Mellon University has a continued mission 
to provide physical, digital, and programmatic access to ensure that students with disabilities have equal access to their educational experience. We work to ensure that 
qualified individuals receive reasonable accommodations as guaranteed by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Students 
who would like to receive accommodations can begin the process through Disability 
MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 28  
 Resources' secure online portal ( https://rainier.accessiblelearning.com/cmu/ ) or email 
access@andrew.cmu.edu  to begin the interactive accommodation process.  
Students with physical, sensory, cognitive, or emotional disabilities are encouraged to self -
identify with the Office of Disability Resources and request needed accommodations. Any 
questions about the process can be directed to access@andrew.cmu.edu , or call (412) 268 -

https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/programs- services/maternity -accommodation-protocol.html  
Providing holistic student support is a top priority at Carnegie Mellon. The protocols on this 
page are designed to support the parental needs of students and their families.  
Students seeking any of the Parental Accommodations described below must register with the Office of the Dean of Students by contacting the office for an appointment by calling 
412-268-2075.  
MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 29  
 Students are encouraged to register with the Office of the Dean of Students ninety (90) days in 
advance of the anticipated arrival of the child as applicable in the individual circumstance.   At 
the time of registering, students will have the opportunity to consult about resources, procedures, funding options and preparation for discussing academic accommodations with the student’s academic department.   Students should also consult with their academic advisors 
either before or in conjunction with registering with the Off ice of the Dean of Students.  
Accommodations for Gestational Parents  
The birth of a child is a significant life event that may require time away from  academic pursuits 
for delivery and recovery from delivery of a newly born  child. Students whose anticipated 
delivery date is during the course of a semester may need to take time away from their academic responsibilities.  Carnegie Mellon students seeking time away are afforded two options as  
possible accommodation:  
• Short- Term Accommodation for Gestational Parents  – A short term absence from 
academic responsibilities up to a maximum of six (6) weeks.   Short- Term 
Accommodation may be extended by two (2) weeks, for a total of eight (8) weeks, where a longer absence is medically necessary. Prior to the absence students must 
work with relevant university faculty and staff to adjust their course work, research, 
teaching and other academic responsibilities during the period of absence. This may 
include extensions of time to complete assignments, incomplete grades, and/or 
dropping courses, shifting research responsibilities and adjusting TA assignments. Students who take a Short- Term Accommodation will remain enrolled.  
• Formal Leave of Absence – A formal leave of absence under the Student Leave Policy. 
Generally, the Student Leave Policy permits students to take a leave of absence for a full- semester, mini -semester, or for the time remaining in the semester during which 
the leave is taken.  Students who take a Formal Leave of Absence ( 
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student -and-student- life/student -leave.html
 ) drop 
all remaining courses for the semester and are unenrolled for the semester. 
International students must consult with the Office of International Education ( 
https://www.cmu.edu/oie/  ) before considering this option due to visa implications.  
Financial Assistance for Student Parents  
Carnegie Mellon also offers the following options for financial assistance to students who 
become parents while enrolled:  
Interest Free Loan  – Any student who becomes a parent is eligible to apply for an interest -
free parental loan  (https://www.cmu.edu/student -affairs/dean/loans/ ) from the Office of the 
Dean of Students.  
7.4 Consensual Intimate Relationship Policy Regarding Undergraduate 
Students  
MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 30  
 This policy addresses the circumstances in which romantic, sexual,  or amorous 
relationships/interactions with undergraduate students, even if consensual, are inappropriate 
and prohibited. The purpose of this policy is to assure healthy professional relationships. This 
policy is not intended to discourage consensual intimate relationships unless there is a conflicting professional relationship in which one party has authority over the other as in the policy.
