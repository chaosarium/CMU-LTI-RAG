Handbook-MSAII-2022-2023
1 Welcome 
Welcome to Carnegie Mellon University!  Being in the CMU School of Computer Science (SCS) 
is a unique experience because of the size of the school (over 2000 students, staff and faculty), 
the quality of its members, the variety of research being conducted, and unparalleled learning 
opportunities.  We encourage you to take advantage of CMU offerings, both inside and outside 
SCS, and also to explore Pittsburgh and southwest Pennsylvania to the extent your schedule 
permits.   What you will find is an environment that encourages and rewards hard work and 
accomplishment.  Pittsburgh has long been an industrial area whose residents build things.  In 
SCS we build things, and you will also.  
While this handbook is specific to your academic experience in the MSAII program, there are 
several other resources and offices graduate students are encouraged to consult during their 
tenure at Carnegie Mellon University. Information about The Word, the student handbook, the 
Office of Graduate and Postdoc Affairs, the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs and others are 
included in Appendix A of this handbook.
