12 Financial Issues 
12.1 Graduate Student Funding  
The LTI does not provide financial aid or support to students in the professional MS programs.  
Students are encouraged to seek financial aid and support from other sources.  The HUB website 
(https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/financial-aid/graduate/index.html ) provides the Graduate Financial 
Aid Guide, information about funding options and how to apply for financial aid and other 
helpful links.  Additional information on financial issues  for graduate students can be found on 
the web at www.cmu.edu/hub/new-grad/ . 
Students in the professional MS  programs are not prohibited from seeking support as Teaching 
Assistants and Research Assistants.  However, typically full-time MS students do not have time 
for these activities.  Typically Research Assistants hips are most likely to be awarded to students 
in Carnegie Mellon’s research-oriented degree programs. 
12.2 University Financial Aid 
Graduate students should consult the graduate student financial aid information found on The 
HUB website: www.cmu.edu/sfs/financial-aid/graduate/index.html .  Students will find the 
Graduate Financial Aid Guide, in formation about funding options and how to apply for financial 
aid and other helpful links. 
12.3 Health Insurance  
Carnegie Mellon has a Student Health Insurance policy requiring full-time, degree-seeking 
students to carry adequate medical  insurance. Students must either  purchase the plan offered by 
the University or an application for a waiver can be made if the stud ent is “enrolled as the 
dependent, partner/spouse or principal in an employer or government-sponsored insurance 
plan” (see the Carnegie Mellon University Student Health Insurance Policy at 
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/ student-and-student-life/student-health-insurance.html ).  
It is the responsibility of each student to make arrangements with Student  Health Services to 
either pay for their insurance at the beginning of  the semester, or elect a payment plan over the 
course of the academic year. More information is available at the Student Health Services Web 
site www.cmu.edu/health-services/student-insurance/ .  
12.4 Emergency Loans  
https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/dean/loans/  
All students regardless of their program are eligible for the Emergency Student Loan, which is an 
interest-free and emergency-based loan repayable within 30 days. It is available through the 
Office of the Dean of Student Affairs; students  may apply for the loan by stopping in to the 
Student Affairs Office, Warner Hall 321, or by  calling (412) 268-2075 for an appointment.
