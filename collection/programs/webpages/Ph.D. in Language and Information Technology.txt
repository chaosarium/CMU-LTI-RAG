Overview: The Ph.D. in LTI focuses on developing the next generation of scientific and entrepreneurial leaders. The first two years of the Ph.D. program are similar to our MLT program. After the second year, you will spend most of your time working closely with your faculty advisor on research that advances the state-of-the-art in computer science.

Ph.D. students are expected to publish papers about original research in the most competitive scientific journals and international conference proceedings, and to present their research at conferences and workshops. Most of our Ph.D. graduates become professors and research scientists, while a few have started their own companies.
Requirements: In general, students pursuing a Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies must

Pass at least 96 units of graduate-level courses.
Satisfy proficiencies in writing, presentation, programming and teaching; and
Propose, write and defend a Ph.D. dissertation (thesis).
Students must also attend the LTI Colloquium each semester and satisfy our Research Speaking Requirement.

For a detailed breakdown of the above requirements, download and read the PhD Handbook.
Curriculum: In order to obtain your Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies, you need to pass 96 units (generally, eight courses) of graduate courses that fulfill these requirements:

At least 72 units of LTI courses: Must include one class in each LTI focus area.
At least 24 units of SCS courses.
At least two lab courses in two different research areas.
Here's a sample of what your five-year schedule might look like.

Requirements

The School of Computer Science requires the following for all Ph.D. applications.

GRE scores: GREs are now optional, but if you want to submit GRE scores:
These must be less than five years old. The GRE Subject Test is not required, but is recommended. Our Institution Code is 2074; Department Code is 0402.
English Proficiency Requirement: If you will be studying on an F-1 or J-1 visa, and English is not a native language for you (native languageâ€¦meaning spoken at home and from birth), an official copy of an English proficiency score report is required. The English proficiency requirement cannot be waived for any reason. Find more information under "Test Scores" on our FAQ page.
Successful applicants will have a minimum TOEFL score of 100. Our Institution Code is 4256; the Department Code is 78.
Official transcripts from each university you have attended, regardless of whether you received your degree there.
Current resume.
Statement of Purpose.
Three letters of recommendation.
For more details on these requirements, please see the SCS Doctoral Admissions page.

In addition to the SCS guidelines, the LTI requires:

A short (1-3 minute) video of yourself. There will be a prompt question that you will respond to. You will have three attempts. This is not a required part of the application process, but it's strongly suggested.
Any outside funding you are receiving must be accompanied by an official award letter.
No incomplete applications will be eligible for consideration.
