tldr: A respiratory distress estimation technique for telephony previously proposed by the authors is adapted and evaluated in real static and dynamic HRI scenarios and the combination of both types of classifiers provides the best joint accuracy and AUC score.
abstract: A respiratory distress estimation technique for telephony previously proposed by the authors is adapted and evaluated in real static and dynamic HRI scenarios. The system is evaluated with a telephone dataset re-recorded using the robotic platform designed and implemented for this study. In addition, the original telephone training data are modified using an environmental model that incorporates natural robot-generated and external noise sources and reverberant effects using room impulse responses (RIRs). The results indicate that the average accuracy and AUC are just 0.4% less than those obtained with matched training/testing conditions with simulated data. Quite surprisingly, there is not much difference in accuracy and AUC between static and dynamic HRI conditions. Moreover, the beamforming methods delay-and-sum and MVDR lead to average improvement in accuracy and AUC equal to 8% and 2%, respectively, when applied to training and testing data. Regarding the complementarity of time-dependent and time-independent features, the combination of both types of classifiers provides the best joint accuracy and AUC score.
